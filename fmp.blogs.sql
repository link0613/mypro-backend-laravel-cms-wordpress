We will teach you how to write an amazing cover letter from proven experts who do it everyday.','<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, this is probably the tenth article you have seen about writing a great cover letter. Since more and more jobs are expecting you to write the perfect cover letter, more people out there want to write about it. How do you know who to trust? Well, you can read a ton of awesome articles from people who have never actually written a cover letter but they sure sound convincing, or you can learn how to write an amazing cover letter from proven experts who do it every day. If this is your first time ever writing a cover letter, you are going to learn step by step how to write a great cover letter. If you are a seasoned cover letter writer but you just want to learn some new tips, keep on reading. In just a second, I will break down exactly how to write an amazing cover letter from top to bottom with detailed examples for you to follow. Get your pen and paper out; it&rsquo;s time to get rocking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Contact Information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your cover letter header should start off by including your contact information. <strong>Name:</strong> First and Last &ndash; Middle name is also O.K. to include. <strong>Address:</strong> Use your real address, even if you are looking to relocate. Using a fake address or P.O. box could come back to bite you in the butt if you get called in for an in-person interview. <strong>Phone:</strong> List all phone numbers if you have more than one. <strong>Email: </strong>Please do not embarrass yourself and have an email like Princessdoglover@gmail.com The Hiring Manager will toss your application out immediately without even reading on. The ideal email address is FirstName.LastName@gmail.com or some variation of that. Steve Smith 1234 W. Turner Rd. San Francisco, CA 94129 (415) 333-1234 Steve.Smith@gmail.com</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Perfect Cover Letter Salutation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes that people make when addressing the person reading their cover letter is saying some basic title like &ldquo;To whom it may concern&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dear hiring manager&rdquo;. Do a little research and figure out who exactly will be reading this letter. Then address them appropriately by their name. How to find this information out:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Check the job posting, a lot of the time it has the hiring managers name on it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anonymously call the company and ask who the manager for the specific department you are applying to is.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Conduct a LinkedIn search by typing in the company and the department followed by &ldquo;manager&rdquo; (e.g., FMP Software sales manager). For larger companies, you can add a filter to identify the exact city &amp; state you are applying to.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking to grow your network? Check out these <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/linkedin-networking-tips-for-job-seekers/\">LinkedIn Networking Tips for Job Seekers.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Amazing Cover Letter Body</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An amazing cover letter body can be broken down into 4 simple paragraphs each with a unique goal. Remember, these are not huge 5-10 sentence paragraphs. They should be short and sweet, anywhere from 2-4 well-written sentences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Paragraph 1 Goal &ndash; Grab Your Reader&rsquo;s Attention</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In your first paragraph, you should state the position you area applying for, the company, and a few key reasons why you are the perfect fit for the job. Here is a slightly tweaked example that you can find in <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples\">this</a> article from themuse. When I was growing up, my only desire was to be one of those people who pretend to be statues on the street. Thankfully, my career goals have become a little more aspirational over the years, but I love to draw a crowd and entertain the masses&mdash;passions that make me the perfect community manager for Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Paragraph 2 Goal &ndash; Show Your Value To The Company</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have your reader&rsquo;s attention, it is time for you to introduce yourself and explain exactly why you are the best fit for the job. First, make sure that you review the job description. Then find relevant skills from your resume that you can highlight for the reader. Bullet points work really well in this section. Examples for a Community Manager position:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Successfully analyze the performance of 30+ marketing programs and identify the best opportunities for optimization resulting in a 40% revenue increase within 2 years.</li>\r\n	<li>Monitor online posts for content and adherence to guidelines with 100% accuracy.</li>\r\n	<li>Negotiate advertising contracts with third party sites and ad companies saving our company over $150,000/year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Paragraph 3 Goal &ndash; Prove Your Interest In The Company</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the section of your amazing cover letter that you need to prove your interest in the organization you are applying to by demonstrating your knowledge of the company. Show the reader that you have actually taken some time to research their company and that you believe in their core values and mission. Here is a slightly tweaked example written by Debra Wheatman @ workitdaily.com. &ldquo;After researching 123 Company, I understand your immediate goal is to improve business performance and establish key benchmarks within . Your recent acquisition of , puts you in a position to gain market share and establish a unique brand presence with potential and existing customers. Given my professional achievements listed above, I am in a position to help you quickly achieve your goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Paragraph 4 Goal &ndash; Wrap It Up And Put A Bow On It</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Briefly, summarize what it is that you will bring to the company and don&rsquo;t be afraid to include some sort of call to action for them to get in contact with you. Tell them that if they have any further questions or would like to set up a meeting that you are available by phone or email. Also, if you plan to follow up, let them know when and how you will reach out to them next so that they can be ready. Lastly, thank your reader for their time and consideration while reading your amazing cover letter. Shazam! You just learned how to write an amazing cover letter from scratch!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S. We Love You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that in the time it took you to read how to write&nbsp;an amazing cover letter, you could have already had one completed?

As a seasoned employee, you have an advantage that entry-level employees do not yet possess. This is the ability to determine what it is that you loved about your old job, and what it is that you hated. I recommend you create a list of pros and cons within your current position. Once you have done that, it is going to be a lot easier to determine what direction you should take this mid-career change. Take a minute right now to create your &ldquo;Mid-Career Change Pros vs. Cons list.&rdquo; Now that you know exactly what it is you like and dislike in a job, you can begin to research careers that you are interested in and decide if they fit your list.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Where to Research Your New Career</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you already know exactly what type of job you want with your mid-career change then skip this section and go down to the next. If you are still unsure, read on. There are a couple basic yet effective ways to determine a solid job for your mid-career change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Online Career Quiz</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about a zillion different online career tests/quizzes that you can take to help you determine where your skills could be useful. Most of these career quizzes are 100% free so don&rsquo;t hesitate to take more than one. Assuming you are aiming for this to be your last mid-career change, it can&rsquo;t hurt to reassure yourself that the results were accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Do A Google Search</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I am sure that you think you are a great fit for a ton of positions. Maybe you are, maybe you aren&rsquo;t. The only way you can know for sure is to research these positions and compare what you find with your recently developed mid-career change list. Say for example you are interested in becoming a &ldquo;Mechanical Engineer&rdquo;. Do a quick search by typing in &ldquo;Mechanical Engineering Jobs Near Me.&rdquo; You are most likely to come across some major job boards or staffing agencies that show a listing for these jobs. Click on a few of them and read the job descriptions. Does this sound like something you are going to enjoy? Do you have any relevant skills to be successful in a position like this? If yes, awesome! The next step is to apply to these jobs. If no, then try this method again with some other job titles. Remember, you want to get this mid-career change right the first time. Bouncing from job to job can reflect negatively on your loyalty. For tips on how to apply for jobs online check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">How To Apply For Jobs Online</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Get Help From A Professional</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a ton of great services out there where you can hire someone to do all the work for you. Simply tell them about your previous experience and they will do the research on where your skills could be best applied. Some of these companies will even adjust your resume and apply for jobs on your behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5 Mid-Career Change Mistakes To Avoid</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the sake of this article, I am going to assume that the next career you choose,&nbsp;you plan to stick with for a while. So please make sure to avoid these common mistakes, or you will quickly find yourself changing careers again.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>One of the biggest mistakes you can make is choosing a job solely because you have a friend or family member who is &ldquo;in the industry&rdquo; and is &ldquo;doing well financially.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li>Do not spend a fortune going back to school on a career that you may or may not even enjoy.</li>\r\n	<li>Think about your bills. Obviously, you cannot go from a career paying you 6 figures to a job paying you minimum wage when you have a mortgage.</li>\r\n	<li>Don&rsquo;t rush; make sure that this mid-career&nbsp;change is a great fit for you! If you haven&rsquo;t created your pros and cons list, you will probably regret it.</li>\r\n	<li>The Lone Ranger Approach. Don&rsquo;t be a lone ranger. There are so many resources out there to help you make this mid-career change so take advantage of them!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S. We Love You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that there is a company out there that will not only teach you everything you need to know about your mid-career change but they will actually help you discover the perfect career and then apply to these jobs for you?

Sadly, this never happens, but have no fear. We are going to provide you with a short list of 16 most common interview questions and answers that you can guarantee you will be asked in your upcoming interviews. We have researched and compiled data from over 10 different online articles from sites such as Forbes, Glassdoor, Monster, Themuse, and Theinterviewguys to save you time and give you only the very best and most common interview questions and answers. Get excited, your next interview is going to be a piece of cake. (Not literally, but you can definitely celebrate after by eating a piece of cake, or two).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is by far the most common interview question of all. This is not your opportunity to tell the hiring manager your life story. Come up with a short (1-2 minute) pitch that describes your work experience leading up to this moment and conclude by explaining how all of this experience has set you up for success in this specific role. If you are entry-level and do not have work experience, you can talk about relevant school projects or life experiences. For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/tell-me-about-yourself/\">Tell Me About Yourself.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. What interests you about our company?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure that you have spent a few minutes researching the company that you are interviewing at prior to the interview. You should know what they do, whom they serve, and why they do what they do. Show interest and passion in some aspect of the company and you will have no problem answering this most common interview question. For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/why-do-you-want-to-work-here/\">Why Do You Want To Work Here?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. What interests you about this job?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus on the work itself and not things about the job such as salary, benefits, etc. The employer wants to know that you are truly passionate about the work you will be doing. Tie in something from the position and explain how you love doing it. (e.g., &ldquo;I love marketing because I am fascinated by the thrill of researching customer needs/wants and finding a way to appeal to each person in a unique and effective way. I believe in the product that your company offers and would love to help educate others on the benefits they would receive from it.&rdquo;) If you can&rsquo;t be genuine with your answer, then you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be applying to the position in the first place! For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-interests-you-most-about-this-position/\">What Interests You Most About This Position?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Why should we hire you?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is your opportunity to brag a little bit about yourself. This is not the time to be modest! Tell the employer how your skills line up with the job duties, how excited you will be to come to work every day, and how well you will blend with the company culture. For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/why-should-we-hire-you/\">Why Should We Hire You?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. What are your greatest strengths?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another great opportunity to shine! You should actually look forward to being asked this most common interview question. Take the chance to affirm a skill that you have relevant to the position and give your best example of a time you put this skill into practice. (e.g., &ldquo;I am an amazing salesperson. In my last role, I was quickly nicknamed the selling machine because in my first week of employment I sold more printers then the most senior rep. in the office&rdquo;). For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-strengths/\">What Are Your Strengths?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. What are your greatest weaknesses?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this is one of the most common interview questions, it&nbsp;still seems to throw people off guard. Find your happy place. This is definitely a good question to think of before the interview because your answer does not have to be job specific so you can pretty much use it for any interview you go into. DO NOT tell the hiring manager that you are lazy, don&rsquo;t show up to work on time, and like to leave early. DO tell the manager a weakness that could also be perceived as a positive (e.g., &ldquo;I tend to overwork myself. I sometimes skip breaks and lunch so that I do not lose my train of thought&rdquo;). Although this is technically a bad thing since you are required to take breaks by law, most employers will light up with joy inside when they hear you say this. For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-weaknesses/\">What Are Your Weaknesses?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. What is your greatest accomplishment?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many variations of this question which makes it one of the most common interview questions. This question should be answered in a fairly similar manner to the greatest strength question. Choose a professional accomplishment that can be related to the job you are interviewing for and tell the story. Make sure to choose the most relevant example of all your accomplishments. For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-is-your-greatest-accomplishment/\">What Is Your Greatest Accomplishment?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Tell me about a time you dealt with a conflict at work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason you are being asked this question is so your interviewer can understand how you react to conflict in the workplace. Anytime you are asked a question starting with &ldquo;tell me about a time&rdquo; you will always want to answer using the S-T-A-R method: Situation &ndash; Task &ndash; Action &ndash; Result. First, briefly provide the context of the situation and task that was being worked on. Next, focus on the action you took to resolve this conflict. Your emphasis should be on highlighting the action that you took which lead to a positive result.

Why are you thinking about leaving your job?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are switching industries, make sure to tell them that you realized your true passion is in whatever industry that you are interviewing for. If you are moving to a similar role then make sure to relate the reason you are leaving to how awesome this new company is, not how bad your old company is. Try to avoid speaking negatively about your company at all costs.

What is your dream job?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Trick question! Your answer better be something along the lines of the company you are interviewing at. Otherwise, the employer is going to have a hard time hiring you knowing there is a constant threat of you going elsewhere if you received an offer doing your &ldquo;dream job&rdquo;. For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-is-your-dream-job/\">What Is Your Dream Job?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>11. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure that your answer aligns with the job you are interviewing at. This is similar to the previous question &ldquo;what is your dream job&rdquo;. If the job you are interviewing at is completely irrelevant to your dream job or where you see yourself in 5 years then that probably isn&rsquo;t a good fit. Show ambition and eagerness to grow within the company. No hiring manager wants to hear that you want to be doing the exact same thing 5 years from now, they want to know you are going to work hard in order to grow in the company.

Are you interviewing with any other companies?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck yes, you are! If you are interviewing at other companies, don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell them. Believe it or not interviewing at other companies will increase your chances of getting an offer&hellip; and faster! The fact that you are interviewing elsewhere shows the hiring manager that they are not alone in thinking you are a great fit for the job. It reassures their decision to interview you, knowing that others are doing the same. Make sure that when you tell them the companies you are interviewing at, you only mention similar positions, in a similar industry. Otherwise, they may question your genuine passion about the position that they are offering.

How would your friends describe you?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are probably 100 adjectives your friends would use to describe you (some nicer than others) so make sure to talk about the most relevant attributes to the job you are interviewing at. Being the guy who can eat more pizza than any of his friends is probably not going to be very beneficial to the interviewer&hellip; Saying that your friends would describe you as extremely persistent and providing a relevant example of the time you left your phone on the bus and traveled to 6 different cities to track down the phone would be a better example. For more details on this interview question check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-would-your-friends-describe-you/\">How Would Your Friends Describe You?&nbsp;</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>14. What are your salary expectations?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;60% of the time, it works every time&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash;Brian Fantana Unfortunately #1: in this scenario, Brian is mistaken. Here&rsquo;s the secret to salary negotiation. The first person to throw out a number is the loser&hellip; 100% of the time. Unfortunately #2: the job seeker is almost always the one who has to go first unless you are a master negotiator. The best thing you can do is research the position and find the estimated pay range using a site like Glassdoor. State the number that you feel comfortable with and don&rsquo;t be afraid to say a salary on the higher end of this range. This shows that you are confident in your self-worth and also puts you in a good situation if they decide to counter offer.

What kind of things do you like to do outside of work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This most common interview question helps the interviewer to know whether or not you will be a good culture fit. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, to be honest. Saying that you enjoy snowboarding in the winter and going surfing in the summer is perfectly acceptable. Maybe you are a wine or craft beer connoisseur who likes to travel to different tastings. All of these things are perfectly fine. Let them know that you are not such a stiff and that outside of work you like to have a good time.

Do you have any questions for me?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is your opportunity to ask any determining factors about the job. If you are good at interviewing, you won&rsquo;t just come into the interview with a list of questions written out. Most of those questions are going to get answered throughout the interview anyways. Prove that you were listening throughout the interview and tailor a question to something that you heard or learned in the interview. Maybe you want elaboration on something said previously, or maybe you want to take this opportunity to ask the interviewer what they like about working here. Whatever you ask is usually fine. Try to avoid saying &ldquo;no, I do not have any questions&rdquo; at all costs.

We will explain what to bring, what to wear, and so much more.','<p>Preparing for a job interview should be an exciting time for you as a potential employee! Many job seekers are intimidated by hiring managers and the entire interview process. This article will break down a few key steps in preparing for a job interview</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What you need to bring to an interview</li>\r\n	<li>What you need to wear to an interview</li>\r\n	<li>And, what&nbsp;kind of interview questions you should practice before the interview</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, in about 10 minutes you are going to learn how preparing for a job interview can be simple and fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What to Bring to An Interview</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s best to keep it simple when it comes to what you bring to an interview. I am going to recommend 6 things that you should bring that can make the difference between you getting the offer, or you getting the boot. <strong>1-Notebook:</strong> A notebook is an essential item to store your notepad, pen, and resumes in a professional manner. This immediately shows organizational skills to the employer as well as professionalism depending on the condition of the notebook. I recommend a plain black (or other dark colored) leather notebook that can fit a legal pad of paper inside of it. <strong>2-Notepad:</strong> Many employers will be impressed by the interest you are taking in the information they are giving you if you are taking notes. Remember, this notepad is not your girlfriend or boyfriend, you do not need to passionately stare at it while you take notes. A balance between note taking and eye contact is very important! <strong>3-Pen:</strong> A notepad without a pen is pretty much useless unless of course, the purpose of this interview is to see who can make the best paper airplane. If that is the case, then I have two main words of advice. 1) Bring heavy paper. 2) Take that job after you win the contest because it sounds freakin awesome! <strong>4-Resumes:</strong> I usually recommend having a minimum of 3 resumes in your notebook at all times. You never know whom you will run into and who will stop in on your interview. I have heard of many stories where a top-level executive happened to be in the office on the day of the interview and requested a copy of the candidate&#39;s resume. If you are the one person who did not have am extra resume to give the CEO of the company, do you think you will be getting the job?</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-professional-resume/\">How To Write A Professional Resume</a></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5-Questions:</strong> This is probably the most dreaded part of the interview. The employer asks you tons of questions the entire time you are there and when they are all finished, they ask &quot;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/do-you-have-any-questions-for-me/\">Do you have any questions for me?</a></strong>&quot;&hellip;. I would write down a couple questions in your notebook before your interview in order to show them that you clearly are interested and have been thinking about the position even before the interview. If they answer all of your questions during your interview, feel free to show them the questions that you had written down and tell them that they did such a great job interviewing that they answered all of your questions! But don&rsquo;t stop there; show them how attentive you are by asking an unplanned question relevant to something that they told you throughout the interview. <strong>6-Smile (winning personality):</strong> I know this sounds clich&eacute;, but it really does work. Interviews can seem extremely repetitive after some time for the hiring manager. Often times something as small as a shining or even sometimes a goofy smile can make you stick out from your competition. If you are as stiff as a robot and have absolutely no personality, I can almost guarantee no one will want to hire you and spend time in the same office as you. Again, disregard everything I am saying if you are applying to become the office fax machine. Preparing for a job interview by bringing these 6 simple things will put you ahead of 70% of your competition. If you don&rsquo;t have these items, make an investment in your future and go get em!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What to Wear to An Interview</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the appropriate interview attire can be a real pain! Take a deep breath and have no fear because your clothing guru is here. Appearance in the workplace is extremely important for many companies. For the most part, your recruiter should advise you on how you should dress when preparing for a&nbsp;job&nbsp;interview. If he/she did not, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask! It is a perfectly normal question. Worst-case scenario, you forget to ask, no biggie. In most situations, it&rsquo;s usually better to overdress than to underdress. Some companies such as Apple, Google, and many startups believe in a more casual work environment. If you were interviewing at Apple you would most likely be advised to wear jeans and a polo t-shirt or button up. No suit and tie needed. For more formal interviews, here are some examples of appropriate interview attire.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Men:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>-Suit (black/gray/navy/etc.) -Button up shirt (white is always safe, but other colors work too) -Tie (red is a solid go-to color. Red = power; however, if possible I will typically match my tie with the companies colors that I am interviewing for) -Long dress socks (black/gray/brown/etc.) -Dress shoes (black/gray/brown/etc.) -Belt (black/gray/brown/etc.) Typically navy blue suits look pretty good with brown dress shoes and brown belt. Black suits look good with a black belt and black shoes. Gray suits look good with black/gray shoes and belts. Optional: tie clip, cuff links, bow tie, and watch. (I usually would recommend at least one article of &ldquo;bling&rdquo; &ldquo;bling&rdquo;. Fun Fact: Studies show that job seekers who wear a watch are much more likely to get the job than job seekers who do not wear a watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Women:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>-Slacks (black will pretty much go with anything) -Button down or blazer (formal interview apparel) -Sweater (casual interview apparel) -Heels (formal interview apparel) -Flats or loafers (casual interview apparel) Now, it is one thing to have nice clothes on your body, but please do not expect the nice clothes to mask any negative personal hygiene skills. It is extremely important when preparing for a job interview to remember to shower, brush your teeth, and tidy yourself up before going to an interview. There is nothing more distracting for an employer than an unkempt candidate. No matter how good of a fit you are for the job, the hiring manager will not hear a word you are saying if they are shrieking from foul body odor! GROSS!! &ldquo;Whoops, I just ate something smelly and now I have an interview!&rdquo; Keep gum in your car or on your person at all times! Gum can be a lifesaver for interviews and so many other occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mock Interview Questions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mock Interviews! Now that we have got you looking and smelling pretty, it is time for us to make you sound as good as you look! Preparing for a job interview is mainly a mental battle. In order to have the confidence that you will succeed in your interview, it is important for you to see yourself succeed on your own. Mock interviews are the best way to test yourself before you go into an interview. I recommend that you practice answering general interview questions so that if you are asked, you will have a well thought out answer. Trust me, your competition will know exactly what they are supposed to say, do not be the only one without a good answer. Listed below are the 16 most common interview questions. If you are interested in learning how to answer these questions (which I would imagine you are) check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-the-16-most-common-interview-questions/\">How To Answer The 16 Most Common Interview Questions</a></strong>. 1.

Did you know that there is a company out there that will train you how to interview like a pro and provide mock interviews for you to practice?

We will break down the two struggles of the interview process, and exactly how to apply for entry level jobs. Struggle 1: I am applying for jobs online but I am not getting any interviews. Struggle 2: I have had a couple interviews, but I am not getting any job offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Struggle&nbsp;1: Landing an Entry Level Job Interview</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find Your Niche</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first thing that any entry level professional needs to do is to find their niche. Everybody is completely unique and has had life experiences that are different from one another. So, what is your niche? Are you an athlete? Or&nbsp;an A+ student? Are you great at fixing things? Are you the type of person that everybody wants to be around? Maybe you are just a grumpy old man looking for your very first job at the age of 93. Whatever it is, you are 100% unique and I promise that there is something about you that someone else wishes they possessed. Once you have found your niche (the thing that makes you unique) it is time to write about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Craft A Resume</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the main place that you can write about your skills and expertise and send it to someone looking to hire? You got it&hellip; your resume! Now, I know that resumes are a pain so if you are not the best resume writer then just go online and do a quick search on&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-professional-resume/\">How to Write a Professional Resume</a></strong>. If you still don&rsquo;t want to learn how to do one on your own, then you can always hire&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/resume-makeover/\"><u>resume writing service</u></a></strong> to do the work for you. The bottom line is if you are an entry level professional looking to apply for entry level jobs you are going to have a little bit harder time trying to fill up that resume. Assuming you have little to no work experience, you are going to need to write about your niche! Instead of a &ldquo;Job Experience&rdquo; section, maybe you can have a &ldquo;Project&rdquo; or &ldquo;Personal Experience&rdquo; section. Depending on the job you are going for, this experience will vary. Here is an example of some skills you could use if you were a recent college graduate seeking a career in finance with no paid work experience throughout college.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>Personal Experience:</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>-Finance Major who excelled in all Finance courses. -Responsible for managing personal finances throughout college without accumulating unnecessary debt. -Assisted other students with financial aid paperwork. -Member of the Financial Management Association (FMA) Club -Applied and qualified for student loans, grants, and financial aid. -Proficient in Excel, JMP, and PowerPoint -Volunteer w/ Cancer Society collecting and managing donations. All of this can be considered experience although it is not necessarily from a paid job. If you have had an internship or part-time work, that is even better! If you are changing careers and acknowledge that you need to start in an entry level role; you will have a little bit easier time with this since you already have some work experience (relevant or not).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be Realistic</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the worst things someone could do when attempting to apply for entry level jobs is being unrealistic with the job you are going to get. Sorry, you probably aren&rsquo;t going to land a 6-figure income right out of college. I know, I know, I just crushed your dreams and goals, but someone had to. Remember, I am here to help. The average salary for someone with a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree fresh out of college is just over $50,000. If the job you are applying to says that they are looking for someone with 5 years of paid experience in X industry then it is most likely a waste of time to apply to that job if you have 0 years of experience. Pretty simple, right? Now that you have realistic expectations, you have discovered your niche, and you have crafted a professional resume<u>,</u> it is time to start applying for jobs. If you are unsure how to apply for entry level jobs online, take a look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">How to Apply for Jobs Online</a></strong>. Furthermore, if you do not know where to apply for jobs, take a minute to glance over <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/where-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">Where to Apply for Jobs Online</a></strong>. Assuming you know how and where to apply for jobs online and have begun to do so, I will move on to the second struggle of the interview process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Struggle&nbsp;2: Landing an Entry Level Job Offer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have mastered the steps listed above and began to apply for entry level jobs you are most likely getting calls about different job offers. Congrats! You are already 80% of the way there. Did you know that on average only 20% of the people that apply to jobs actually ever get a call back for the job?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Embellish A Bit</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Landing an entry-level job offer can be tough. One thing that you should be doing once you get a call from a recruiter or hiring manager is embellishing a bit. If you think that the guy who got the job instead of you didn&rsquo;t embellish, you are gravely mistaking my friend. What do I mean by embellishing, well I do not mean lie; this would be immoral. What I do mean is have some confidence! If there are two people with 100% equal skill sets but the hiring manager asks: <strong>&ldquo;How would you rank your ability to speak with customers?&rdquo; </strong> Job seeker A says: I am an absolute pro. I speak with customers in my sleep and when I wake up in the morning, I eat, breathe, and think about speaking to customers. (Please do not eat your customers). Job seeker B says: I like to think that I am pretty good at speaking with customers&hellip;.. Who do you think is going to give this hiring manager more peace of mind? The guy who is ALL ABOUT CUSTOMERS, or the guy who thinks he is pretty good. All jokes aside, if you are not confident in your abilities to do the job, then how can you expect the recruiter or hiring manager to be confident in you?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Show Personality/Excitement</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Woohoo!!! Yippee-ki-yay! Heck yes, brother! Yep, I went there. This is the kind of excitement that you should bring to your interview. I do not mean literally scream these things at the guy/gal giving you a call. But inside, you should be fired up! Why? Not just because you are a 20%er getting a phone call for an interview. But also because if you are not excited about the job you are getting a call for, you can guarantee that the person calling you is going to feel insulted and unappreciated. It is crucial to do everything in your power to show this hiring manager that you are pumped up about their company. The person calling you chose to make a career with this company. Show them that you think they are the coolest thing since crushed ice for being a part of that company. With just a tiny bit of embellishment and the right amount of excitement, you are going to melt these hiring manager&rsquo;s minds! Good luck!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S. We Love You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that there is a company out there that will not only teach you everything you need to know about how to apply for entry level jobs but they will actually apply to these jobs for you?

We explain how to apply for jobs online in 5 simple steps.','<p><strong>Click. Click. And... Click. </strong>This is the all too familiar sound you experience applying to job, after job, after job, with basically nothing to show for all your time and effort. Are you sick and tired of applying for jobs online, wondering if your resume is even being looked at? In this short article, I will lay out for you exactly how to apply for jobs online in 5 simple steps. If you are unsure where you should even be applying to jobs, I would highly recommend that you take a look at our article <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/where-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">Where to Apply for Jobs Online</a></strong> before continuing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Perfect The Resume</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I know this is the last thing that you want to hear, so I will not spend a lot of time on it, but it is absolutely crucial that you are refining and optimizing your resume for whatever type of job you are going after. This is the number one priority when learning how to apply for jobs online. Did you know that over 60% of companies use something called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)? This is a form of software that screens your resume before it even gets in the hand of the recruiter or hiring manager. If you don&rsquo;t have the exact keywords on your resume that they are looking for, your resume may not even get looked at. There are a ton of free resume builder tools out there to help you craft a great resume. If you would rather leave it in the hands of a professional, there are also a lot of great paid services where you can hire someone to do the work for you. For more information on resumes, take a look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-professional-resume/\">How To Write A Professional Resume</a></strong>. Moving on&hellip;. Finally!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Don&rsquo;t Wait!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever been lead on by a recruiter or staffing agency? They give you a call, ask you all about yourself, and tell you about a position that you could &ldquo;potentially&rdquo; be a great fit for!? If you haven&rsquo;t yet, you will. So many recruiters mislead job seekers into believing that they will get a job so you become content thinking; &ldquo;Oh, I spoke with a couple recruiters who are trying to help me find a job, I can relax now.&rdquo; AGHHHH, wrong. How has that been working out for you? The point is, <strong>don&rsquo;t wait!</strong> If a recruiter gives you a call, you can guarantee that the same recruiter is going to call another 100 people by the end of the day. Make sure you are constantly applying to jobs online instead of waiting for a call back from a recruiter you spoke to a week ago. There is also another point to be made regarding not waiting. Have you ever gone on a job board such as Indeed and seen a job that was posted only 6 days ago that already has 100+ applicants? Good luck landing that job. At that point, the hiring manager is so swamped with resumes that you can guarantee he/she will not be looking at all of them. This is where that ATS comes in handy for the hiring manager. Being among the first 10 applicants to apply for a job is absolutely crucial! How do you do this? Well, you need to be constantly checking the job boards. Use their filters in order to find the most recently posted jobs and apply to a few each day as they come up. This is exactly how to apply for jobs online like a pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Apply In Bulk</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This one does not need much of an explanation. We talked about this briefly under the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Wait&rdquo; section. The main point here is that you should NOT be applying to one or two jobs and then waiting for a call back. No recruiter or hiring manager is going to know how many jobs you have applied to online. Apply to as many relevant jobs as possible to increase your chances of landing an interview. This is simply the law of large numbers at work. The next section will explain how to apply for jobs online in bulk, without wasting a ton of your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Quick Apply</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Quick apply features are great! Not every company is going to have them but for those that do, take advantage of them! If you are unsure what this is, quick apply is basically a feature that allows you to apply for a job in as little as one click; instead of having to fill out an entire job application. Some online job boards that offer these features are ZipRecruiter, Indeed, CareerBuilder, and the list goes on. However, in order to fully take advantage of these quick apply features, it is extremely important that you invest some time upfront making sure that your profile on these job boards are top notch. For a list of sites that will make your life easier, check out the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/10-best-career-sites-to-land-your-dream-job/\">10 Best Career Sites To Land&nbsp;Your Dream Job</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Invest Time Upfront On A Profile</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every job board is going to ask you to upload your resume so that it can create your unique profile. The problem is, some of these job boards do not do a very good job at making sure all of the content on your resume goes into the right places on the profile. They will put your education where your work history should go, and your list of skills where your summary should go. They are all over the place. This is why it is important to invest time upfront making sure that your information is in the correct fields. Also, take a moment to fill out each section of your profile with as much detail as possible. Taking a few extra minutes to make a great profile will save you hours of filling out job applications. Now that you know how to apply for jobs online, GO! There is no better time then the present. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Wait!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S.

Believe it or not, only 14% of university graduates have a job secured upon graduation.','<p>YOU DID IT!!! You just graduated or are soon to be graduating from college and for most; this will be the greatest accomplishment of your life&hellip; So far, anyway! Let me say now, Congratulations! Unfortunately, it is time to get back to work. Landing a job after college is not an easy task. Believe it or not, only 14% of university graduates have a job secured upon graduation. Ideally, you already have bundles of internships and years of relevant work experience under your belt. But let&rsquo;s be honest, college is tough and it&rsquo;s even harder to get a job in the right industry while being a full-time student. Don&rsquo;t worry, we understand your situation and it so happens that this is very common! So common, that we have laid out a &ldquo;How To&rdquo; guide below, which will show you how to optimize your efforts in order to find a job after college, regardless of your work experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Little To No Work Experience?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you partied every day or struggled to keep your grades up, the fact is&hellip; You graduated! That expensive piece of paper hanging on your wall was the goal to better your career path and land a job after college. You may not have made all the ideal career choices during your schooling, but there is nothing you can do about that now. To optimize your chances of receiving callbacks, you must be able to translate all relevant&nbsp;experience from your classwork and any volunteer work you have done. This is a catch 22 because hiring managers only care about what is relevant to the job you are applying for so please don&rsquo;t include how many years you had to babysit a sibling; unless of course, you are applying to become a caregiver.

You must know the lingo and business terms of the desired industry you plan to enter. Companies use scanning programs to filter out resumes relevant to what they are looking for in a candidate and if your wording is not strategically chosen, a human will not even look at your resume. If you have already set out on a job search campaign and have not received any response, it is time to swallow your pride and fix what is broken! If you need help or feel overwhelmed, there are tools and services at your disposal to increase your chances!

You must be realistic in your job search as it is a very personal process. It only takes a few rejections to start feeling like you will never get the opportunity you desire even though you are a great candidate. I am sure you are awesome, but the fact of the matter is you need to prove it. This can be extremely rewarding when you reach the pinnacle of your goals, but until then, you must&nbsp;pay your dues! Don&rsquo;t assume you are above an assistant position or a job that requires no experience (Directed at those of you who relate to the &ldquo;Little to No Work Experience&rdquo; section). This is a long term process and you will not regret starting at the bottom of the right opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use All Available Avenues</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many resources at your disposal to find a job after college and it is important that you use them all to broaden your outreach to hiring managers. You are at a severe disadvantage if you only use one avenue to apply for jobs. These options include Job Boards, Company Websites, Staffing Agencies, and the Career Center at your University. I am not going to spend time debating on which option is best because like I said, you should be using ALL OF THEM! OK, I am done lecturing, but the more you explore your options, the better your chances get of landing that fulfilling job you dream about. To learn exactly where to apply for jobs and optimize your job hunt take a look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/where-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">Where to Apply for Jobs Online</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Avoid These Common Mistakes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, you should have a general idea of the etiquette and unwritten rules of the job search process after college, but I would like to emphasize a few key mistakes that are easy to correct. Like I stated above, it is best to be open to all opportunities after graduation. Please do not show up to a scheduled interview already assuming you have the job &ldquo;in the bag&rdquo;. Confidence is great, but arrogance is easy to pick up on and a hiring manager is trained to sniff out these types of candidates. Treat all employees at the company you are interviewing at with respect. It is also important to be open to relocation. You do not want to miss out on a great job after college&nbsp;because it is a short plane flight from family and friends. Eventually, you can be pickier about location, but limiting your options because of location can be detrimental to your long-term goals. Change can be scary, but so can unemployment! Follow up is also very important as it shows determination towards the potential opportunity. Even a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; email to the hiring manager/interviewer thanking them for their time can speak volumes towards the character of a candidate. Most important of all, do your homework. Just because you are done with school, does not mean you are done learning. Do not let your ego get in the way of your job search. Don&rsquo;t assume your resume or cover letter is rock solid. If you are not getting call backs, there are reasons for this. There is nothing wrong with admitting you do not know everything about an industry or desired skill. After all, you are entry-level. There are&nbsp;a vast amount of resources at your disposal,&nbsp;take advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S. We Love You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that there is a company out there that will not only teach you everything you need to know about finding a job after college, but they will actually apply to jobs for you?

Rest assured that in about 5 minutes you are going to know exactly where to apply for jobs online.','<p>Are you new to applying for jobs online? Or maybe you have been applying online for ages but you aren&rsquo;t sure if you are focusing in the right places. Whatever it is, rest assured that in about 5 minutes you are going to know exactly where&nbsp;to apply for jobs online.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where To Apply For Jobs&nbsp;- Company Sites</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Company websites are by far the most effective places to apply for jobs online. Why? There are 2 main reasons. First, when you apply directly on a company website you are bypassing 100% of the expenses that the company would normally have to pay to a staffing agency or job board. Let me put this in perspective for you. Let&rsquo;s say that you had a clone. You are exactly the same. Same skills, same resume, same everything. Do you think that a company is more likely to hire&hellip;. A) The version of you that applied directly on the company website costing them $0.00. Or B) The version of you that is coming from a staffing agency that is charging this company an additional 40% on top of your salary for &ldquo;discovering you&rdquo;. Congratulations, you are correct. The answer is obviously (A). Second, you are showing genuine interest in the company by seeking out their website, finding the place to apply, and taking the time to fill out their application. This is very different from a staffing agency calling you because they found your resume online and wanted to know if you are interested in so and so job. Hiring managers know this, and they respect the person who is applying directly on their website and know that they are typically the ones who are more passionate about working at their company. Unfortunately, although this is the most effective way to apply for jobs, this is also probably the timeliest. This brings me to good ole job boards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where To Apply For Jobs&nbsp;- Job Boards</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Job boards, unlike applying directly on company websites, can be extremely efficient if you know what you are doing. In our article <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">How to Apply for Jobs Online</a></strong>, we break down exactly how to efficiently apply to jobs, particularly on job boards. I am sorry to be the one to tell you, but all job boards are not created equal. Some are simply amazing, while others stink. Depending on your specialty, there are some great job boards out there&nbsp;for you. Here&nbsp;are a few key players:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Indeed.com &ndash;</strong> Indeed offers a lot of great jobs. Their platform is not the most aesthetically pleasing&nbsp;BUT personally, they are my favorite. Indeed offers great filters, customized user&nbsp;preferences, advanced search techniques, and their &ldquo;Apply with your Indeed Resume&rdquo; feature is pretty awesome.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>ZipRecruiter.com &ndash;</strong> ZipRecruiter is also a great platform. Their user interface is by far the best out of any job board I have seen. They have a &ldquo;One Click Apply&rdquo; feature where all you need to do is click a button and wallah, you applied. They also have a pretty cool mobile app where you can easily be notified and apply to jobs directly on your phone.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Careerbuilder.com &ndash;</strong> CareerBuilder made&nbsp;the list mainly because it has one fantastic feature that I really wish Indeed and ZipRecruiter would adopt. CareerBuilder allows you to use a quick apply feature similar to ZipRecruiter and Indeed except CB has an option where you can flip a switch and ONLY see the jobs that are quick to apply too.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Although ZipRecruiter and Indeed have this quick apply functionality, they do not let you filter your search to only see these types of jobs. So, you will find yourself scrolling through page after page looking for these quick apply jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where To Apply For Jobs - Recruiting Agencies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh recruiting agencies, everybody&rsquo;s favorite people to deal with. Trust me, I know; they are a horrible necessity. Recruiting agencies, especially the big ones, are worth giving a try. It really cannot hurt to go online, or give a call to these companies and ask if they have anything available. The problem is, they will lead you on because they want to get paid! If you speak with an agency, make sure you are also applying on company websites, and applying on job boards. Do not EVER call an agency and sit around waiting for them to call you back. You will be extremely disappointed. Some of the bigger agencies to consider contacting are: -Allegis Group -Adecco -Randstad Holding -ManpowerGroup -Kelly Services Go online and create a profile or give these companies a call and let them create a profile for you. The more places you apply for jobs online the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where To Apply For Jobs - LinkedIn</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, but not necessarily least, is LinkedIn. LinkedIn can be a great place to network for jobs online. Unfortunately, if you don&rsquo;t have a LinkedIn currently or you barely ever use your LinkedIn, this will probably take a while for you to get any value from it. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/19-essential-linkedin-profile-tips-for-job-seekers/\">19 Essential LinkedIn Profile Tips For Job Seekers</a></strong> LinkedIn allows you to connect with professionals in your desired industry who you can either approach for a way into a company or approach for some advice on your industry in general. Once you have built a network of relevant professionals it can be an extremely personal tool to use when searching for a job. Assuming you have a LinkedIn and have already established a solid network of professionals in your industry, the next step would be to contact these professionals. Now, these individuals are probably extremely busy, and typically their job description is not going to include &ldquo;helping random people on LinkedIn get a job at their company&rdquo;. So make sure that if you are going to contact someone on LinkedIn you are crafting a very personal and well thought out message to get this person&rsquo;s attention. Maybe compliment them on a recent article they have published and ask them how they got started in their career. Tip: People love talking about themselves. It is their favorite thing to talk about! If you can show genuine interest in someone on LinkedIn, you are going to have a lot better chance receiving a positive reaction when you finally ask them if they can share your resume with the appropriate party within their organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S.

From personal experience, I can tell you that your profile is about 10 times more likely to receive a click&nbsp;if you have a LinkedIn photo when&nbsp;compared to the person without one. Don&rsquo;t worry; this shouldn&rsquo;t cost you a penny. You can either browse through your existing photos with the below recommendations in mind or take a new picture. A friend or family member can take the perfect LinkedIn photo&nbsp;for you in just a couple minutes. Before you go find your camera man/woman there are a few things that you need to know.<strong>Sanity within your smile</strong> Please do not have a frown or angry expression. No recruiter will call you if you look like you are a scary or mean person to talk to in your LinkedIn profile photo. This is also true for overly happy people or someone laughing in their LinkedIn photo. Studies have proven that people with too large of a smile either come off as fake or deranged. Please don&rsquo;t look like the Joker. An upward slanting, moderately happy smile will do. <strong>Dress for the job</strong> Find out what the average person in your industry wears to work, and dress appropriately. If you know that you will need to wear a suit to work, then don&rsquo;t wear a t-shirt in your LinkedIn profile photo. Remember, it is better to overdress than underdress. Even if you are in a startup environment with casual dress attire, it can&rsquo;t hurt to throw on a button-up for your LinkedIn photo, after all, this is a professional network and you never know what opportunities might find you. <strong>Shoulders up</strong> Men and women respect yourselves and crop your LinkedIn profile photo&nbsp;appropriately. The photo should focus on your face, above the chest line, but we&nbsp;definitely recommended to include the shoulders. A straight shot of your face can be a little bit overwhelming. You want to have the camera positioned far enough where there is some space to see the background. I would recommend your face taking up about 60-70% of the entire frame. <strong>Subtle background</strong> Your background should either be unfocused, or it should be a very basic surface that will not cause a distraction to the viewers. The focus should be on your face. <strong>Choose a recent photo</strong> Make sure to set realistic expectations with whoever is viewing your profile. If you are looking for a job and you are in your mid 40&rsquo;s but you add a photo of yourself from your 20&rsquo;s then you can guarantee that you have lost trust with the interviewer and you will not get the job. Be honest, and upfront. Find a recent picture or take a new one. Now that you know the 5 most important tips for a great LinkedIn photo, grab your camera or go through your pictures and get started. You are going to notice an immediate increase in profile views once you do this. Good luck!

Start w/ A Catchy Headline</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Your headline is the most visible piece of information to recruiters and hiring managers which is why this is LinkedIn Profile tip #1. Instead of writing your current job title and company, make sure that you mention the type of job you are looking for and what you bring to the table. Here are a couple of examples: &ldquo;Sales professional who has literally sold ice to an Eskimo.&rdquo; &ldquo;Organized executive assistant specializing in making your life easier.&rdquo; &ldquo;Author/Writer specializing in LinkedIn tips for job seekers&rdquo; For more on LinkedIn headlines, check out&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/linkedin-headline-ideas-that-dont-suck/\">LinkedIn Headline Ideas That Don&rsquo;t Suck</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"Catchy LinkedIn Profile Headline\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5701\" src=\"/uploads/Headline-1024x527.png\" style=\"height:336px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>2. Broaden Your Location</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you live in a smaller town next to a large city that you are willing to work in? If so, make sure that you put the closest large city in your location so that you will be easier to find.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Profile Location\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5703\" src=\"/uploads/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-8.52.15-PM-1024x383.png\" style=\"height:244px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>3. Add A Relevant Industry</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a relevant industry will help recruiters find your LinkedIn profile much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Profile Industry\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5704\" src=\"/uploads/Industry-1024x322.png\" style=\"height:205px; width:651px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>4. Customize Your URL</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This LinkedIn profile tip is often times overlooked for years. Who wants a URL with a bunch of random numbers next to your name? If you haven&rsquo;t already, select &ldquo;Profile&rdquo; and click the little gear/cog next to your Profile URL under your picture (do this on a desktop). This will take you to a page where you can customize your URL on the upper right-hand side. Edit your URL so that it is (linkedin.com/yourname).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"Custom LinkedIn URL\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5705\" src=\"/uploads/URL-1024x346.png\" style=\"height:220px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>5. Select A Professional Photo</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure that your profile photo represents you in a professional manner. Smile, face the camera&nbsp;and try to dress nicely. Best practice is to take a look at profile photos of others in your industry and see exactly how they are presenting themselves. See <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/5-tips-for-a-perfect-linkedin-profile-photo/\">5 Tips For a Perfect LinkedIn Profile Photo</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>6. Add A Background Photo</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A background photo is always a nice touch for your profile. It adds an additional piece of personality and excitement to your professional LinkedIn profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Profile Background Photo\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5706\" src=\"/uploads/Background-Photo-1024x172.png\" style=\"height:108px; width:645px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>7. Spice Up Your Summary</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This is your opportunity to show who you really are and happens to be one of the most important LinkedIn profile tips of all. The summary is a great section to not only show off the achievements or any relevant, industries specific, work experiences you have. This is also a great section for you to add some personality. Do not be afraid to speak in the first person and speak directly to the hiring manager/recruiter reading your summary. Your summary should be tailored towards your target audience while telling a story about yourself, your experiences, skills, and achievements. An ideal summary is 3-5 short paragraphs. A good tip would also be to include your contact info in the summary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>8. Use Only Relevant Experience</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A common mistake that job seekers make is putting too much information on their profile. Make sure that if you are applying for an engineering position you remove your babysitting experience. If you have no relevant work experience, try to think of relevant projects, volunteer work, or even life experiences that relate to whatever field you are trying to get into. A recruiter should be able to skim through your LinkedIn and know exactly what you are looking for without being confused by unrelated work experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"Relevant Work Experience LinkedIn\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5707\" src=\"/uploads/Experience-1024x354.png\" style=\"height:225px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>9. Add A Current Job, Even When Unemployed</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unemployed and your LinkedIn is showing that you have no &ldquo;current&rdquo; job it will be a lot harder for a recruiter to find you. LinkedIn offers a filter when searching for people with the option to look for &ldquo;current&rdquo;, &ldquo;past&rdquo;, or &ldquo;current and past&rdquo; professionals in a given industry. In order to save a ton of time, recruiters typically look for &ldquo;current&rdquo; employees. A LinkedIn profile tip to help you get noticed is to add your desired job title such as Executive Assistant or Sales Professional followed by Seeking Opportunities or In Transition in the Company Name box.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Work Experience\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5708\" src=\"/uploads/Add-relevent-industry-1024x392.png\" style=\"height:250px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>10. School, Work, Or Personal Projects</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you that have little to no work experience, it is extremely important to make up for this with any school or personal projects that relate to your desired job</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Education Section\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5713\" src=\"/uploads/Eduaction-1-1024x346.png\" style=\"height:220px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>11. Utilize Volunteer Experiences</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Some studies show that people who have volunteer experience on his/her LinkedIn profile are 20% more likely to get hired than those who don&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t speak to the validity of that statistic, but it definitely can&rsquo;t hurt to add volunteer work if you have it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Volunteer Experience\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5709\" src=\"/uploads/Volunteer-Experience-1024x505.png\" style=\"height:323px; width:654px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>12. Add Multimedia To Your Profile</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This LinkedIn profile tip is sure to add some color and style to your profile, making it more enjoyable to look at. Many people fail to utilize the multimedia feature on your profile. Take a look at the profile of someone with multimedia under his or her summary and work experiences and compare it to someone who doesn&rsquo;t. Multimedia can spice up your profile by adding images and showcase some of your work. Add photos, videos, links, and slideshows to your profile. If you don&rsquo;t have any work to show off, just try adding the URL to your company website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Profile MultiMedia\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5712\" src=\"/uploads/Add-Multimedia-1024x377.png\" style=\"height:239px; width:650px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>13. Strategic Skills Only</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A common mistake that job seekers make on their LinkedIn is adding way too many skills. Do you really expect a recruiter to believe you have all of those skills? And even if they did, are ALL of them relevant to the type of job you are looking for? Make sure to be strategic with the skills you add. The more skills you add, the fewer endorsements you will get on each skill. Start with 10-20 relevant skills and work your way up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn Profile Skills\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5711\" src=\"/uploads/Skills-1024x385.png\" style=\"height:245px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>14. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The skills you add on your profile also play a factor in SEO. But they are not the only things playing a factor. Make sure to go through your LinkedIn profile at the end of this article and add any relevant keywords that you think an employer will be using&nbsp;to find someone for the job. This particular Linkedin profile tip is also very useful&nbsp;for&nbsp;your resume. For information on how to use SEO in your resume, read <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs/\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For&nbsp;Jobs</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>15. Add Your Contact Info</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This seems obvious but surprisingly is overlooked a lot. Add your contact info to your profile so that the recruiter can get ahold of you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>16. Join Relevant Groups</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>By joining groups you will increase your chances of finding someone, or someone finding you for a job. Of course, you will want to be strategic about the groups you join. Join industry specific groups and begin networking with other professionals in your desired role. You might even run into someone that&nbsp;can offer you some additional LinkedIn profile tips that we haven&#39;t mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"LinkedIn groups\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5714\" src=\"/uploads/Groups-1024x600.png\" style=\"height:382px; width:652px\" /></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>17. Add Your Interests</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding interests to your LinkedIn profile allows your viewer to learn a little bit more about you. Who knows, maybe a common interest that you have with the hiring manager will be the little extra push he needed to give you a call.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>18. Network Within Your Desired Industry</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Groups aren&rsquo;t the only way to meet industry specific people. Once your profile is completed don&rsquo;t be afraid to search LinkedIn for people in your desired industry. Use the search bar at the top to type in your desired job title or industry and then add a filter to view only your second-degree connections. These people have the best chance of accepting your invite since you already have a mutual friend in common.

Having a catchy LinkedIn headline is the very first step to help&nbsp;your profile stick out from the crowd. The good news is that your LinkedIn headline is one of the easiest and most effective areas that you can fix. If you haven&rsquo;t already noticed, your headline will default to your current job title and company. For example, if you are currently a sales manager at the&nbsp;company Find My Profession, your headline will automatically read &ldquo;Sales Manager at Find My Profession&rdquo;. If you are going for boring and uninspiring, then make sure to keep your default headline. If you actually want to get noticed and create a LinkedIn headline that doesn&rsquo;t suck, then make sure to add something compelling and interesting to start attracting those recruiters!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Be specific but not boring &ndash; Tell people exactly what you do while captivating the reader to want to learn more.

In this article we are going to teach you all of the LinkedIn networking tips necessary to find your dream job.','<h2>How I went from 100 to 15,000 strategic connections.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are anything like I used to be, you own a LinkedIn account, but you probably don&rsquo;t use it much. You don&rsquo;t use it because it really hasn&rsquo;t proven to be valuable in any way for your life or career. I remember feeling the exact same way. I had a really basic&nbsp;LinkedIn Profile with about 100 connections, mostly classmates, professors, etc. It wasn&#39;t until I started to look for a job that I really understood the importance of networking on LinkedIn. One day, I decided to give it a try. I knew I wanted to grow my network and expand my reach outside of my immediate friends and classmates. After all, they weren&rsquo;t helping me find a job; they didn&rsquo;t even have the ability to do so. I decided to start adding recruiters and hiring managers as LinkedIn connections from all the cities that I was open to working in. I probably sent out 1,000 invitations my first day and within 1 week I noticed that over 500 of them clicked&nbsp;&quot;accept&quot; on my invite. First of all, I want to point out that if it wasn&rsquo;t for me previously spending time making sure that my LinkedIn profile was top notch, I probably would not have received all these accepted invites. If your profile is still looking below average, then make sure to read <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/19-essential-linkedin-profile-tips-for-job-seekers/\">19 Essential LinkedIn Profile Tips for Job Seekers</a></strong>. Once you have made the necessary changes to your profile, it is time to start adding some strategic LinkedIn connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LinkedIn Networking: Take advantage of free filters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter what membership of LinkedIn you have (even the free one) you are allowed to use some basic filters. Type in whatever kind of person you are looking to add to your network in the search bar at the top of the page. For example, if you are looking for a sales position, type in &ldquo;Sales Recruiter&rdquo;. Once you hit enter or the little blue magnifying glass, you will notice some basic filters on the left side of the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>1. Choose what you are targeting</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we are looking for People, click &ldquo;People&rdquo; on the upper left-hand side. Once you have done this, the next filter you should add is &ldquo;2nd Connections&rdquo;. Why should you filter by 2nd connections? To answer that, it would help for you to know what the difference is between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree LinkedIn connections. <strong>Difference between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd LinkedIn connections</strong> 1st connections are people that you are currently connected with (friend). 2nd connections are people that at least 1 of your 1st-degree connections is connected with (friend of a friend). 3rd connections are people that at least one of your 2nd-degree connections is connected with (friend of a friend of a friend). You will always have the smallest number of 1st connections and the largest number of 3rd connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>2. Focus on 2nd connections</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Just for this one example, compare LinkedIn to Facebook. Have you ever received a friend request from someone with absolutely no mutual friends? That usually is a red flag that this is a random person you probably don&rsquo;t know. Are you more likely to add the person that you do not recognize with 0 mutual friends, or the person you do not recognize with 100 mutual friends? 100 obviously. The chances are, you are thinking that maybe you ran into this guy at some party or event and you just don&rsquo;t remember. LinkedIn networking works the same way. When you send someone an invite, they are much more likely to accept it if you have some common connections. This brings us back to why you would want to add the 2nd connections filter. It is important to know that if you add too many people and they say they do not know you, LinkedIn can put a temporary block on your profile so you cannot add any more connections. (This is why you should avoid 3rd connections, and stick to 2nd). Don&rsquo;t be too worried, this block will either be undone at the first of each month or you can email LinkedIn and let them know you are sorry and you were unaware of this rule. They are extremely understanding and easy to work with. I know this from experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>3. Target a specific location</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have added the 2nd connection filter, it&rsquo;s time to choose the cities you want to work in. Select as many cities or states that you are open to work in as possible. If the location you are looking for is not immediately visible, you can click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button and type in just about any location in the world to begin your LinkedIn networking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LinkedIn Networking: Time to get clicking&hellip;.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we have discussed all the boring filters and your search results are extremely targeted, it&rsquo;s time to start adding your LinkedIn connections. Since you spent a lot of time upfront filtering the perfect search, you will be able to add connections much quicker. Go through the list of people and let the clicking begin. Simply click &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; for each person that you would like to connect with. I recommend adding just about everybody in the beginning. Once you start converting 2nd-degree connections into 1st-degree connections, your network will begin to multiply and you can become more selective. The best part is, every person you add does not just bring you closer to that 1 person. It brings you closer to however many connections they have. So, if only 1 person accepts your invite but they have 500 connections, you now have 500 more 2nd connections to filter through. If you connect with 10 people who all have 500 connections, you now have 5,000 additional 2nd connections! Your network will begin to grow exponentially and you will start to increase your chances of getting discovered for the perfect job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LinkedIn Networking: Am I a L.I.O.N.?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What is a L.I.O.N.? A L.I.O.N. stands for a &ldquo;LinkedIn Open Networker&rdquo;. &nbsp;A L.I.O.N.&nbsp;is someone who will add anyone and accepts + actually encourages others to send them requests because they will always accept their invite 100% of the time. Adding people that you don&#39;t know personally for business purposes does not make you a L.I.O.N. You can still be selective about who you add on LinkedIn or whose invitations you accept. I actually recommend avoiding the L.I.O.N. approach. The more strategic you can be with the people you connect with the higher quality 2nd and 3rd-degree connections you will have. If you add 100 people in a totally foreign country, then you can guarantee you are going to start seeing a bunch of 2nd connections pop up in your searches that you have absolutely no intention or reason to connect with. Today, by doing exactly what I have taught you above, and without ever paying a penny for a premium membership, I have over 15,000 connections on LinkedIn. Each connection was strategically chosen&nbsp;to help expand my career. And let me tell you, it has paid off BIG TIME! Not only do I receive job offers daily, but learning these techniques have helped me excel in the business world. By adding 15,000 strategic connections I have access to over 2.3 million 2nd connections. I truly feel that I have connections in just about every industry and&nbsp;every part of the world, thanks to the amazing opportunity that LinkedIn provides.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get Started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s time to begin&nbsp;with&nbsp;your LinkedIn networking.

There are 4 steps to keep in mind that will guarantee results!','<p>Your resume work experience is by far the most important section&nbsp;of your resume. Whether you want to call it &ldquo;Work History,&rdquo; &ldquo;Work Experience,&rdquo; &ldquo;Employment History,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Employment Experience,&rdquo; it really makes no difference. There are 4 steps to keep in mind when writing about your resume work experience that will guarantee results! Side note: Some people will tell you not to include unpaid work such as internships or school projects in your resume work experience section, but we have proven them wrong time and time again. The fact is, if you have never had a paid job to add to your work experience section, then it&rsquo;s a lot better to add these things then to leave it blank. On the other hand, if you do have paid work experience, you should probably create a separate section on your resume for internships and projects labeled, &ldquo;Relevant Projects/Internships.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. List Only Relevant Work Experience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you have 0 or 25 years of experience it&#39;s extremely important to only list relevant work experience on your resume. One of the most common mistakes that cause people to not get the job is trying to be &quot;well-rounded&quot;. It&rsquo;s important to understand that whatever job you are applying for has a specific picture in mind of the perfect candidate. Do you really think they are going to want a customer service manager with sales, design, nursing, and engineering experience? Probably not. You come off as a confused individual who has no idea what you want to do with your life. With that being said, your resume work experience section should&nbsp;only list relevant information. If the job you are applying for is&nbsp;a customer service manager, then it would behoove you to only list customer service management skills. You might have 25 years of work experience overall, but don&rsquo;t expect a senior position if you are going into an industry that you really only have 2 years of relevant experience in. Now, if you are a recent graduate, you were probably taught some pretty bad resume tips from a tenured employee who hasn&#39;t personally looked for a job in years. Please ctrl+alt+delete everything you have learned up to this point! Moving forward, take a look at the job description for the position(s) you want to apply for. If these are in line with your degree, you should have some relevant coursework or internships that will show off what you can bring to the table. This includes school projects, clubs or organizations, volunteer work, internships, etc. Find something, anything and focus only on the tasks/achievements you have related&nbsp;to the job. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-to-include-in-a-resume-16-best-things/\">What To Include In A Resume - 16 Best Things</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Be Strategic</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So you have sent the same Resume and Cover Letter to 100 companies and have not received a single call back. To put it nicely, it is time to change your approach. You will see much better results if you craft a slightly different resume for each position you apply to. Like stated above, each position has different requirements and are looking for a specific candidate. Your resume work experience should change depending on the job you are applying to. If you focus on the slightly different requirements of each job, you will join an elite group of applicants. These changes can be minor but will make all the difference. Think about it; are a couple minutes of research worth landing the&nbsp;career you have been dreaming of? Everyone would say, &ldquo;OF COURSE!&rdquo; but few put in the extra work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Keywords Are Everything</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too technical with you, at least not in this article. But there is a reason that everyone tells you to adjust your resume work experience for&nbsp;each job. Just to give you a super quick idea why this actually matters, it&rsquo;s because of something called ATS or Applicant Tracking Systems. In an attempt to simplify what an ATS is; it&rsquo;s essentially a robot that scans through every single person&#39;s resume that applies to the job and finds the very best ones. They decide whom the best ones are by scanning the content of the resume and seeing which ones have the most keywords in common with the job description. I am not saying to copy and paste the job description into your resume, but you should be looking at these job descriptions and customizing your work experience to use some of the main keywords. For more on keywords, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs/\">How To Use Resume Keywords&nbsp;When Applying For Jobs</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Quantify Achievements When Possible</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The above sets a great foundation for a quality resume, but if you are able to quantify your work achievements, you have just skyrocketed to the very top. Let me explain&hellip; Hiring managers love numbers, figures, success stories, anything that can make them feel totally confident that you are an over achiever. Compare these two bullet points for a sales managers work experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Managed a team of sales reps in the retail industry</li>\r\n	<li>Managed an elite team of over 30 sales professionals in the retail industry resulting in a 300% growth in quarterly revenue year after year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Which one do you think is going to impress the reader more? Now, not everybody is going to have such success in every role where they can quantify their results in the resume work experience section. However, if there is ever anything that you achieved, or were recognized for, then make sure to show it off! Recruiters and hiring managers love this kind of stuff. It is perfectly OK if you are not able to quantify your achievements. The worst thing you can do is blatantly lie because even if that lie gets you into an&nbsp;interview, hiring managers are trained to dig into your resume, especially when it comes to numbers you have presented. Overall, be honest and whenever possible, quantify your achievements (relevant to the position) on your resume work experience. Good luck!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S. We Love You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are like most people, then you probably are not a big fan of writing resumes. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a>&nbsp;</strong>offers professional <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/resume-makeover/\">resume makeover services</a></strong> so that you can save time and stick out from your competition!</p>','4-tips.jpg','2016-12-01 08:53:55','4-tips-to-write-your-resume-work-experience-section','4 Tips To Write Your Resume Work Experience Section','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(15,1,'What To Include In A Resume - 16 Best Things','This article will give you resume writing ideas so that you will know what to include in a resume when applying to your next job.','<p>Did you know that on average an employer spends only 6 seconds reviewing a resume before they move onto the next? You can&rsquo;t waste time having useless information on your resume. This article will give you resume writing ideas so that you will know exactly what to include in a resume and what not to include when applying for your next job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Contact Info Section</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Always include detailed contact info on your resume. Without contact info, no matter how great your resume is, the employer will have no way to get ahold of you. <strong>1. Your Name -</strong> First &amp; last name.&nbsp;If you would like to include your middle name or initial go right ahead. <strong>2. Home Address -</strong> City &amp; state only. DO NOT provide your exact address. This can be a privacy/security issue since just about anyone can access your resume on job boards. <strong>3. Email Address &ndash;</strong> Make sure to use a professional email. Good Example: Sally.Smith@gmail.com Bad Example: collegepartygirl123@gmail.com <strong>4. Phone Number(s) &ndash;</strong> Include your phone number as well as the type of phone. Examples: (c) 123-456-7890 or (h) 123-456-7890 or (o) 123-456-7890 (c) = cell phone (h) = home phone (o) = office phone <strong>5. Personal Website Or LinkedIn &ndash;</strong> Add your personal website or LinkedIn urls to your resume. You can even hyperlink your name to include this info.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Professional Summary Section</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is your opportunity to grab the employer&rsquo;s attention by summarizing your job desires and the relevant skills that you bring to the table. <strong>6. The Summary &ndash;</strong> Tailor your professional summary to the specific job you&rsquo;re applying to. An employer is definitely going to know when you are using a generic summary to apply to multiple jobs. Below are a few examples of what to include in a resume summary:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&ldquo;Aspiring Test Engineer capable of performing inspections and testing of incoming components, in a processed product and finished products within the manufacturing arena to ensure compliance with established specifications and departmentally defined timeframes.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li>&ldquo;Inside Sales Representative with a strong work ethic, exceptional sales skills and a successful track record of growing sales revenue.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li>&ldquo;Driven Executive Assistant adept at developing and maintaining detailed administrative and procedural processes that reduce redundancy, improve accuracy and efficiency and achieve organizational objectives.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on your resume summary, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-great-resume-summary-statement/\">How To Write A Great Resume Summary Statement</a></strong>. <strong>7. Keywords From Job Postings &ndash;</strong> Remember to include&nbsp;specific keywords from the job posting in your resume. You will not only want to do this in your summary, but also in your work experience section. The better you get to know the job posting(s) you are applying to, the easier it will be to know what to include in&nbsp;a resume. For more on keywords, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs/\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For Jobs</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Key Skills Section</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;skills section is your opportunity to brag a bit. Tell us what you are good at. Focus not only on your top skills but the ones&nbsp;most relevant to the job. <strong>8. Key Skills &ndash;</strong> List 6 - 8 skills that you want your future employer to know you possess using relevant keywords from the job description. Try to avoid personality traits, and focus on technical skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Work Experience Section</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This might be the most important part of your entire resume. Knowing what work experience to include in a resume is absolutely crucial to your success. Employers want to know when, where, and how you worked at your current or previous jobs. <strong>9. Relevant Work History &ndash;</strong> Make sure you are not wasting the employer&rsquo;s time reading irrelevant information for your work history. List only the relevant duties, achievements and accomplishments that relate to the job you are applying to. <strong>10. Internships, Projects, Volunteer &ndash;</strong> If you don&rsquo;t have any relevant work history, the next best thing would be to add internships, projects, or volunteer experience that may relate&nbsp;to the position. <strong>11. Metrics &ndash;</strong> Whenever possible, make sure to use metrics when describing your work experience. Instead of simply listing out the things that you did at your job, talk about your achievements, successes, and accomplishments. <strong>Good Example: </strong>Increased revenue by 40% and the number of guests by 35% through promotional marketing channels and increased customer experience. <strong>Bad Example:</strong> Responsibilities included increasing company revenue through promotional marketing channels and increased customer experience. For some more tips on the work experience section, read <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/4-tips-to-write-your-resume-work-experience-section/\">4 Tips To Write Your Resume Work Experience Section</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Education Section</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When figuring out what to include in a resume, the education section can be somewhat tricky. Your education can be very important if you are a recent graduate or early in your career. However, the more work experience you gain, the less important your education becomes. <strong>12. Education &ndash;</strong> If you went to school, add your education. If your degree goes beyond high school, please do not include the HS you went to on your resume. No matter what level in your career you are, place your education at the very bottom of your resume. Having your education at the top of your resume makes you look junior which is never beneficial (even if you are applying to a junior role). <strong>13. GPA &ndash; </strong>Unless you have graduated with a very high level of honors such as Magna Cum Laude, do not list your GPA on your resume. There can be exceptions depending on your major but for the most part, this is not necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Additional Information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, this&nbsp;is your opportunity to set yourself apart from other resumes. Include some interesting information that shows involvement, success, and makes you unique from your peers. <strong>14. Additional Information &ndash;</strong> This could include but is not limited to publications, affiliations, honors, awards, websites, clubs, organizations, and certifications. <strong>15. Professional References &ndash;</strong> Do not include references on your resume. Do not even write &quot;references available upon request.&quot; If you are personally asked for references, provide them. Believe it or not, recruiters will take the contact info from your references (usually hiring managers) and use it to solicit new business for their agency. <strong>16.

In this article, we will outline a few essentials you need&nbsp;to write a great resume summary. First off, it&rsquo;s important to note that there IS a difference between a resume objective and a resume summary statement. Let&rsquo;s clear this up now&hellip; <strong>Resume Objective &ndash; </strong>Just about every resource online will tell you to avoid using an objective. We agree. They are extremely boring and outdated! This method lost popularity long ago. Objectives are more of an &ldquo;I&rdquo; statement which&nbsp;states what you are looking for. Your resume should focus on how you can add value to the reader. Example: I am seeking a position in the retail industry focusing on sales or customer service. <strong>Resume Summary &ndash;</strong> The resume summary statement has replaced the objective and is much more effective at communicating how you will benefit the company. The fact of the matter is, your resume is not for you; it&#39;s for the person reading about you. This is your first real impression of the company so you have to nail it! The resume summary is arguably the most important part of the entire resume. If you have a boring summary statement that doesn&#39;t relate to the position, it&rsquo;s unlikely that anyone will continue reading. The next&nbsp;most important sections of a resume can be found in the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/top-5-resume-sections-you-cant-go-without/\">Top 5 Resume Sections You Can&#39;t Go Without</a></strong>. Example: Software Sales Account Executive with over ten years of experience. Versatile, bilingual professional with account management experience ranging from mid-sized accounts to multi-million dollar accounts. Ability to prospect and close hundreds of deals per year, while ensuring individual account satisfaction and growth. This resume summary works for a few reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It&rsquo;s very straightforward and to the point.</li>\r\n	<li>The job title is stated right away, so it&rsquo;s clear that if this is a sales position, we have&nbsp;a solid fit.</li>\r\n	<li>We show off our experience by stating the number of years we have in the industry.</li>\r\n	<li>Finally, we demonstrate our value to the reader. We did this by telling them we have the ability to manage accounts of all sizes, as well as close hundreds of deals per year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure to tie in your skills with what you believe the company needs, specific to the job description. Yes, you might&nbsp;swing and miss at a few opportunities before you get your resume summary just right, but that&rsquo;s Okay! This should be no longer than 3-4 sentences. You will explain your experience and skills&nbsp;in other sections of your resume. Focus on your most relevant skills in combination with the skills that you feel separate you from other applicants and you are guaranteed to write a great resume summary statement.

We teach you how to write a professional resume that will get you hired.','<p>Have you ever wondered why you keep applying to jobs without receiving any calls or emails? Are these companies even viewing your resume? (Probably not). You might be surprised to learn that the main reason for this is because of the quality of your resume. Professional resume writing is a learned skill just like whatever job you&#39;re applying to requires a certain set of skills. The average Joe is not going to be a <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/resume-makeover/\">professional resume writer</a></strong>. In this article, you will learn how to write a&nbsp;professional resume that is sure to make you stand out amongst 99% of your peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Research relevant job descriptions (Most Important Part)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This&nbsp;is by far the most important step to take when learning&nbsp;how to write a professional resume&hellip; Has anyone ever told you that before applying for a job you should&nbsp;tailor your resume specifically for each job? That is ridiculous and a huge waste of time. Now, I am not saying that if you are applying to sales jobs you should&nbsp;use the exact same resume to apply for engineering jobs. But, what I am saying is that there is a much more strategic way of doing things. First, you HAVE to know exactly what kind of a position you want. Unfortunately, general resumes just do not work anymore. Recruiters and hiring managers are so picky and have access to so many different resumes that if your resume is not exactly what they are looking for, they are going to move onto someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>&ldquo;How do I know what they are looking for?&rdquo;</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a lot easier then you would think. All you have to do is go on any of the major job boards (Indeed, ZipRecruiter, CareerBuilder, etc.) and type in the position that you are interested in. If you want to become a Sales Associate in San Francisco, type in &ldquo;Sales Associate&rdquo; for the job title and &ldquo;San Francisco&rdquo; for the city. If you want to become a Mechanical Engineer in Denver, type in &ldquo;Mechanical Engineer&rdquo; for the job title and &ldquo;Denver&rdquo; for the city. Simple enough, right? Once you type in the position that you are interested in, read a couple of the job descriptions to find out what sort of skills these jobs require. You will quickly notice that a lot of the positions have the exact same requirements as one another. <strong>These are the keywords that you want to use when you write your professional resume.</strong> Find your next job by learning<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">How To Apply For Jobs Online.</a></strong> This next section will explain why using the same verbiage as these job postings is so important when learning how to write a professional resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making it through ATS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who cares if my resume doesn&rsquo;t have the same wording as the job posting, it&rsquo;s close enough, right?&rdquo; Wrong! Have you ever heard of an Applicant Tracking System or ATS? These are tools that hiring managers use in order to filter through hundreds of different resumes in seconds. Before they even look at your resume you can guarantee that it is going through an ATS. An ATS ranks resumes from best to worst based on the relevancy of the keywords on your resume. Since Applicant Tracking Systems are just man made computer programs, they are never going to be perfect. That means that if your resume says &ldquo;sales professional&rdquo; and the company is looking for a &ldquo;sales expert&rdquo; guess who is only going to rank for half of the keywords? That&rsquo;s right, Mr. &ldquo;Sales Professional&rdquo; over here. This is just a tiny example. Most companies use tens or hundreds of keywords in order to filter these resumes. Make sure you come out&nbsp;on top of the competition by reviewing various job descriptions to determine the common keywords that these companies are using. This is exactly how to write a professional resume that will get you hired. You can guarantee that the majority&nbsp;of other applicants did not put in the time researching before they wrote&nbsp;their wannabe professional resume. For some extra help, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs/\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For Jobs</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6-second rule (short and sweet)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that on average a hiring manager spends 6 seconds reviewing a resume? In other words, if you ranked high on the ATS then you got about 2 minutes of viewing time (10% of resumes) and if you rank low on the ATS you only got around 2 seconds (90% of resumes). Since you only have a few seconds to catch the hiring manager&#39;s attention, <strong>do not waste space on your resume with irrelevant work experience.</strong> I do not care if you worked at McDonald&rsquo;s 10 years ago as a line cook. Neither does the hiring manager, trust me. If you are applying for a mechanical engineering position then don&rsquo;t put your McDonald&rsquo;s experience on your resume. This is how to write a professional resume 101, but sadly it needs to be said. Only include the most relevant experience or projects when you write your professional resume. Despite common misconceptions, most people do not need to write a resume that is longer than one page. If you are&nbsp;an upper-mid to senior level professional with 10+ years of working experience then you would be an exception. But even then, the CEO of Yahoo Marissa Mayer, can fit her resume on one page, why can&rsquo;t you? To find out what is necessary and what is not, check out our checklist on&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-to-include-in-a-resume-16-best-things\">What To Include In A Resume - 16 Best Things</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use a resume builder or a resume writing service</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If everything that I just said blew your mind and seemed totally overwhelming, congratulations, you are normal. I would have the same reaction if you explained to me what it is that you do for a living. Learning how to write a professional resume is not easy and can&nbsp;take some time.

As long as you put in the effort to include the corresponding resume keywords, you have a huge chance at receiving a callback. If you think you have all the right keywords and are still not receiving any&nbsp;call backs, go back to the drawing board and reword your resume. Tired of wasting time on resume keyword optimization? Maybe you just have better things to do.

We can help.','<p>Searching on the Internet for advice in regards to organizing your resume sections can have you leaving with more questions than answers. The fact is, there is not one right way to do this. The reason being, there are many employers who have different opinions on what makes a great resume. Below is&nbsp;advice for following the &ldquo;norm&rdquo; in regards to the sections of a resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Section 1 - Contact Info</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, no kidding!&rdquo;&hellip; This is obviously at the top of your resume and the only reason we mention it is to remind you to proofread your phone number and email address&hellip; We wouldn&rsquo;t mention this if we haven&rsquo;t seen them presented incorrectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Section 2 - Objective or Summary?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SUMMARY! Professionals say this resume&nbsp;section is optional, but if strategically worded, this can be one of the key deciding factors for the employer to schedule an interview with you! It&rsquo;s important that you know the difference between an Objective (outdated) and a Summary. For more on the differences read <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-great-resume-summary-statement/\"><strong>How To Write A Great Resume Summary Statement</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Section 3 - Work Experience/Education</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have no work experience and are a recent graduate, we advise&nbsp;that you place your education near the top of your resume. If you are a recent graduate with&nbsp;work experience, your education section should be towards the bottom. Please&nbsp;make sure that you include only relevant&nbsp;experience in this section! If you don&rsquo;t, the hiring manager may get lost in the noise of your resume and pass you up completely. Check out<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/4-tips-to-write-your-resume-work-experience-section/\"><strong> 4 Tips To Write Your Resume Work Experience Section</strong> </a>for a more detailed breakdown of the experience section on your resume, with examples!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>For Career Changers&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You have the ability to list additional experience that you feel may be transferrable to your new career path. This could help you make up ground against someone who may have&nbsp;more experience than you in your desired field. Remember,&nbsp;quantify your achievements rather&nbsp;than listing your job duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Section 4 - Skills</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many question whether or not the skills resume section is actually necessary. Some say you should only use this section for a technical position that needs specialized skills such as software experience. We challenge that notion because every position has technical requirements, so to speak, and this is the section you can outline these skills the best. Stick to 6-8 bullet points of 3 to 4 words or less. Make sure to do some research if needed in the industry &ldquo;Lingo&rdquo; so that you can use the right keywords to stand out! Check out <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-professional-resume/\"><strong>How To Write A Professional Resume</strong></a> to learn the tips and tricks to get your resume in the hand of the employer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Section 5 - Education</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not a recent graduate, your education should always go towards the bottom. Although this may be your greatest accomplishment, unfortunately, employers care much more about work experience than where or when you went to school. This&nbsp;resume section is really only to show that&nbsp;you possess a degree. Don&rsquo;t get carried away with this, keep it simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S. We Love You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, there are many ways to format a resume and some industries require specifics that others do not. If you are unsure where to start, sticking to the above layout will definitely be the most widely accepted way to format your resume.

A professional resume style will help you stand out from the crowd and get hired quicker.','<p>Below is a break down of some basic things to consider when deciding whether or not your resume style is professional. Between your headers, fonts, and the overall themes, it is important to remember to present yourself professionally, while keeping in mind the 6-second rule. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the 6-second rule, it basically states that the average employer spends 6-seconds viewing each resume before moving on. A professional resume style will help the employer find what they are looking for quicker, making every second count.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Style - Headers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your headers should be formatted with the same characteristics throughout your resume (ex. Font Size, Underlined, Bold, Italicized, etc.). We suggest 18-24 size font and consider the use of Bold and Italic. You should make it easy for the reader to quickly find what they want.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Style - Fonts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, the font should not play a big role in the overall resume style. There is no need to get fancy with a font&hellip; This does not express your individuality as some may believe. We suggest you stick to the basics of Times New Roman, Calibri, or Arial. The headers have a little more wiggle room, but it is not necessary to vary from the standard accepted fonts. The more common your font is the more familiar the reader will be with it, making the resume easier to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resume Style - Themes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many professionals recommend keeping your resume black and white. This can be a really gray area that seems to be moving towards adding a little bit of color. First, this really depends on where you are and what type of role. Most new, techy, startup-y companies in large cities would be totally fine with a bit of color. While some 100-year-old professional investment firm might appreciate a plain black and white resume. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the entire body of your resume should be bright pink but it does mean you can slightly adjust headers, contact info, and your name with conservative colors such as red or blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Make Your Resume Scan-able!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of having a great resume style is making sure that your resume is scannable. You can be the most qualified candidate and perfect for the job, but if you do not know how to express this on paper, you will most likely not receive a callback. Make sure you utilize bullet points to better outline your skills. As you know, you have 6-seconds, so make sure to be short and sweet, only mention the good stuff.

Explain what experiences you have had and the skills you have gained through your previous job, education, projects, etc. Next, lead into how these past experiences got you to where you are now, your Present.

While I was at TSG I managed our sales team of roughly 8 sales reps. My team was constantly exceeding quota every quarter due to the great work environment that we had created. However, I am currently looking for a new challenge and the opportunity to manage a larger team. I have a passion for renewable energy, cars, and sales so I can&rsquo;t think of a better place to be interviewing then right here at Tesla. I would love nothing more than to bring my sales management expertise into the constantly growing and already amazing team here at Tesla.&rdquo; One thing that is absolutely crucial to remember is that your answer should slightly vary depending on the job you are applying to. The example given above would really only be appropriate for a sales/management position. If this same person were interviewing for an engineering job, that pitch would not be very effective. You want this to sound natural, not scripted, but you also want to take the time to practice your answer before going into the interview. I hope by reading this you will&nbsp;feel a lot more confident the next time you are asked: &quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot; If you have any questions or want to practice&nbsp;your pitch, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a></strong> to learn all about our professional <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/interview-training/\">interview training</a></strong> and mock interviews.</p>','Basic.jpg','2016-12-09 06:44:53','tell-me-about-yourself','Tell Me About Yourself - Interview Question | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(24,1,'Describe Yourself In 5 Words','Hopefully you are reading this before your interview... being asked to describe yourself in 5 words is a very common interview question.','<p>Hopefully, you are reading this before your interview and not dwelling on the questions you may or may not have answered correctly. Either way, being asked to describe yourself in 5 words is a very common interview question. There are people who can talk about themselves all day&hellip; Despite how you feel about these people, they are at quite an advantage here!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Whatever You Do, Don&rsquo;t Say &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Know!&rdquo;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to avoid general verbiage when you describe yourself. Examples of this would be Team-Player, Punctual, or Committed. These should be assumed in any candidate and will come across as boring. Think of how many people are going to give these basic answers, don&rsquo;t be like them! Set yourself apart from the masses and provide truthful character traits that will resonate with the interviewer. Also, make sure to avoid words that one can perceive as negative such as Stubborn, Out-Spoken or Independent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So What Do I Say?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Below is a list of appropriate answers to the question, &quot;Describe yourself in 5 words.&quot; <strong>Diligent/Loyal/Reliable</strong> &ndash; I am always the first person that my friends call because they know I am always there for them. I put the same effort into making sure my work is done correctly, and I am always available to help my peers. <strong>Creative/Innovative</strong> &ndash; I love trying new things, creating new methods, and introducing new ideas. My creativity has grown to help me solve problems in the workplace that others can&rsquo;t by thinking differently. <strong>Motivated/Ambitious/Leader</strong> &ndash; I believe I am very driven. Throughout college, I was active in 3 clubs, worked full time, and still managed to graduate at the top of my class. As the oldest sibling, I have always been somewhat of a leader. My brothers and sisters constantly look up to me for advice. <strong>Honest/Ethical</strong> &ndash; Ever since I was a little kid I have tried to stay ethical. I remember one time I found 6 Disneyland tickets and $200 cash in an envelope. I turned the envelope into the store where I found it. My honesty paid off when no one came to claim it and I was able to keep the content. <strong>Friendly/Social</strong> &ndash; All my friends tell me that I am the nicest person they know. I always enjoy meeting new people and love making new friends. It is important to think of explanations for whatever words you choose. Go above and beyond their typical answer. Tell them how these words apply to your life and give an example that backs it up. This may be difficult for those who are shy and have problems opening up, but this is a great life skill.

But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t be strategic with your honesty. Many people think this is some sort of trick question. They answer by saying, &ldquo;Nothing, my last boss loved me and I was an All-Star!&rdquo; Unfortunately, that is not the correct answer and is not what the interviewer wants to hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nobody Is Perfect, Don&rsquo;t Pretend To Be</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We all had insecurities as kids, but as you grow up, you should be aware of your faults. This is called maturity. If you act like you don&rsquo;t have any faults, you may come off as cocky or insecure. The best approach is, to be honest. There is a way you can actually turn this into a positive question! You do this by stating a negative trait, unrelated to the position you are applying for, and explain how you are already working to improve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>I&rsquo;ll Start, Then It&rsquo;s Your Turn</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> &ldquo;What negative comment would your boss say about you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Growing up and even into adulthood, I was terrified of public speaking! I have since joined the Chamber of Commerce and have been making a point to speak with as many people as possible. I have learned as long as I practice and prepare, public speaking is not as terrifying as it once was.&rdquo; <strong>Recent Grad:</strong> &ldquo;What negative comment would your professor say about you?&rdquo; &ldquo;One of my professors commented to me that I should focus my attention on school, instead of always being so active in extracurricular activities. This wasn&rsquo;t because my grades were hurting; I received an A in this class, however, there were times that I would arrive late, rushing from work to class. After he made his comment, I was able to adjust my work schedule to make sure I was never late again.&rdquo; <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-the-16-most-common-interview-questions/\">How To Answer The 16 Most Common Interview Questions</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Check The Job Description</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This question is geared for catching red flags. If you mention any negative traits that are needed to be successful in the position you are interviewing at, you probably won&rsquo;t get hired! If you state a weakness that does not affect the position, you win in two ways. First, you were honest and second, there are no immediate red flags. Another mistake to avoid is throwing previous coworkers under the bus! The unfortunate part is a scenario may be 100% someone else&rsquo;s fault, but you will look like a whiner. Coworkers should only be brought up in a positive light in interviews as this shows you work well with others. This goes for managers and supervisors as well. A common clich&eacute; from employees is &ldquo;My supervisor has no idea what they are doing!&rdquo; If you state this in an interview, we guarantee you will portray yourself as a &ldquo;Know it all&rdquo;&hellip; and to be honest, nobody wants to hire that type of person.

I am also the type of person who does not really need to plan anything or write anything down. Good Answer: I am extremely detail oriented. I am easily able to manage multiple tasks at once. I have personally always kept a detailed calendar with all of my important dates, deadlines, meetings, and events in order to stay organized.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Technical Position</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What are your strengths?

I am extremely detail oriented and am constantly learning the latest trends to reduce footprint.

You should use these only as basic guidelines, and then build off them for your own answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Icing On The Cake</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To go above and beyond, add a sentence explaining how these strengths will relate to the exact position you are applying for. Instead of just saying, &ldquo;I am extremely ambitious. I love being social and meeting new people. My mother always told me that I should become a sales person because I do not understand the word no.&rdquo; Try saying, &ldquo;I am extremely ambitious. I love being social and meeting new people. My mother always told me that I should become a sales person because I do not understand the word no. I would love the opportunity to bring my competitive spirit and can-do attitude to the amazing sales team here at ABC Company.&rdquo; Now, practice this a couple times before each interview and you are all set!

We have heard more people struggling to answer this question... What are your weaknesses','<p>This is one of the most dreaded interview questions of all time. We have heard more people struggling to answer this question than just about every other question out there. What are your weaknesses? That&rsquo;s a pretty personal question. Why am I being asked this question?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Am I Being Asked This?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason you are being asked, &ldquo;What are your weaknesses&rdquo; is so the employer can test your honesty, as well as actually finding out some of your weaknesses. Nobody is perfect, and your employer does not expect you to be. But they do expect you to be honest. The person who says, &ldquo;I have no weakness. I am perfect!&rdquo; is not a very smart person. There you go, I just found a weakness for that person. It&rsquo;s important to confess a true weakness, but also to make sure you are doing this in a strategic way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Strategic Way</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are applying for a sales position, you better hope that your weakness is not that you are scared to talk to people. That will directly impact your success in the position and is going to play a huge factor in you not getting the job. If your weakness is that you were never very good at test taking, drawing, snowboarding, or technical troubleshooting, then you are probably safe in a sales interview. Does this make sense? It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to admit a weakness. I have about 10 million personally. But I am going to limit myself to which ones I confess based on the job I am applying for. If you are applying for a nursing position, please do not say that you get nauseous around sick people. Instead, say that you have never been that great at selling things. Your job is to help people. Maybe a weakness of yours can be that you are too caring. You often get taken advantage of because you are constantly caring too much for people and trying to help others. Although this is an amazing quality to have, this is a perfect weakness to confess that will actually score you some points in the interview.

Make sure that you confess this weakness in a humble manner. If you say that your weakness is caring too much, but you say it in a way that you are clearly not convinced this is even a weakness, the employer is going to read right through you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bonus Points</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever your weakness is, if you can follow up by explaining what you are doing to address this weakness in a positive way, you will earn some bonus points. For example, &ldquo;I am not the best speech giver, however, I have been taking communications courses at my University in order to practice. I have given multiple speeches in front of the classroom and I am constantly working to turn this weakness into a strength.&rdquo; Speaking of strengths, learn how to answer <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-strengths/\">What Are Your Strengths</a></strong>&nbsp;today!

If you are a recent grad, or someone with very little relevant career experience, then you would be an exception. Try to find a life accomplishment that could emphasize a skill that you need in order to do your job. For example, if your position requires a lot of stamina, and training, the preparation and running of a marathon could be a great answer. No matter your experience, even if your greatest accomplishment is graduating college, it is important that you pay attention to this next section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Tell A Story</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever your answer is, make sure to tell a story. The employer does not just want to know what you did, but who, when, where, and how you did it as well. Here is an example: &ldquo;Last December, my company was struggling to meet their end of year revenue. We had about 8 days left till the New Year and we were short just over $1.5 million dollars. As the sales manager, it was my responsibility to get my team pumped up and make sure that we met our goal. Keep in mind; our average monthly revenue was around $1 million dollars so achieving $1.5 million in 8 days was a huge task to take on. For the remaining days, I organized brief team meetings; call blocks and cash prizes for the reps that closed the most deals. The end result was $1.9 million dollars in 8 days. We not only saved the quarter but also greatly exceeded anyone&rsquo;s expectations.&rdquo; This is a great example of someone who told a story to describe his greatest accomplishment. From this example, you can assume he was applying for either a sales or management position. If it was not one of those two positions, it probably was not the best answer. Depending on the position, your answer should vary. Similar to the interview question <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-strengths/\">What Are Your Strengths</a></strong>; this is another great opportunity to brag about yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>P.S.

This can be a difficult question to answer on the spot. You are probably thinking about ten different reasons why you want the job, but it&rsquo;s important to prepare your answer before the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Answers To Avoid</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The position pays well.&rdquo; &ldquo;What interests me most about the position is that it is with Google and you guys are a great company!&rdquo; &ldquo;I really like that you offer catered lunches and a full bar.&rdquo; &ldquo;The people at ABC Company seem really nice.&rdquo; &ldquo;The benefits are great!&rdquo; Try to avoid focusing on company perks, culture, and brand names. Instead, focus on the actual job duties of the position you are applying for. Don&rsquo;t get what interests you most about the position confused with what interests you most about the company. Check out our article for more career advice on how to answer the interview question, <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/why-do-you-want-to-work-here/\">Why Do You Want To Work Here?</a></strong> It&rsquo;s important to know why these questions are being asked in order to mold your answer in an effective way. Your potential employer is asking you what interests you most about this position in order to gauge your understanding of the position you are applying for. Here are some of the reasons the employer could be asking you this question. 1) Do you fully understand what this position entails? 2) With this understanding, do you still feel you are a good fit? 3) Will you enjoy this type of work? Make sure to address the employer&#39;s concerns when you answer this interview question. Here is an example of an acceptable answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Correct Answer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What interests me most about this position is the opportunity for me to work hands on with the sales team. Many other companies I have interviewed at for sales manager positions are very hands off. They seem to be more focused on monitoring activity and pipeline, then the actual development of the sales reps. Training others and passing on my SaaS knowledge has always been a passion of mine, and I feel that ABC Company shares similar values. Allowing me to train and mentor these sales reps will result in a huge increase in productivity and overall revenue gained.&rdquo; For more interview questions and answers check out the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">50 Top Job Interview Questions And Answers.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are truly excited about the opportunity then this interview question should not be very challenging. But don&rsquo;t think that you can just walk into any interview and toss out a perfect answer. It&rsquo;s important to know what to avoid, and what to focus on when crafting your answer to the question, &ldquo;What interests you most about this position?&rdquo; If you need some extra help preparing for the interview or if you just want someone to practice with, visit <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a></strong> and sign up for our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/interview-training/\">interview training</a></strong> today.</p>','positon.jpg','2016-12-14 07:05:46','what-interests-you-most-about-this-position','What Interests You Most About This Position - Interview Question','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(30,1,'What Are Your Long-Term Career Goals?','What are your long-term career goals?

Have you ever been asked this question in an interview? This may seem like an easy question, but in reality, the right answer might be tougher than you think. Don&rsquo;t walk into an interview unprepared. In this article, we will break down the do&rsquo;s and dont&#39;s when answering what your long-term career goals are. When you think about your life goals, you may recall your 2nd-grade teacher telling you to &ldquo;Reach for the stars!&rdquo; Everything was possible whether you were&nbsp;to become a professional athlete, movie star, musician, or the next man on the moon. In what seems to be a blink of an eye, life progresses, and our goals begin to narrow. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing; it&rsquo;s just life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Be Realistic</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dialing in your aspirations is something that everyone should do, but for most, little effort is put forth. The reason you are being asked, &ldquo;What are your career goals&rdquo; in an interview is partly because this is an indicator of your sense of reality. If you say something like &ldquo;Well, I plan to use this entry-level position to display my talents and become CEO in a couple years.&rdquo; Although ambitious, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that you will get the job. The other reason you are being asked this question is because the interviewer wants to make sure the job is a good fit for you. If your long-term career goal is to become a mechanical engineer and you are applying for a sales position, it probably isn&rsquo;t the best fit. Let me put you in the mind of a sales manager (employer) who hears you say you want to become an engineer in the future&hellip; <em>&ldquo;Is this dude serious? Does he even know this is a sales interview?&rdquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;Hmm, if he wants to become an engineer, I wonder how long he will actually work here before he quits?&rdquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;I really need a new employee, but I kind of feel bad hiring someone who really doesn&rsquo;t even enjoy sales.&nbsp;</em> Yes,&nbsp;this article has&nbsp;some pretty extreme examples, but I do not want to make light of how serious this is. Even if you are joining an inside sales team, but you want to work in outside sales, or if you are joining a design team, when you want to become a developer, these are huge differences that can be roadblocks to landing the job.

That is if you actually want the job. Now, I am not saying that you should lie, but you probably shouldn&rsquo;t tell the truth if you really do not see yourself being at the company long term. Unfortunately, about 10 million recruiters and hiring managers are trying to figure out who wrote this article so that they can send me hate mail. But it&rsquo;s the truth. Do you want a job or not? There&rsquo;s no point in going to the interview if you plan to say the wrong things. Here is an example of how you should answer. Sales Manager (Employer): &ldquo;What are your long-term career goals?&rdquo; Interviewee: &ldquo;My entire life I have aspired to become an enterprise level account executive at ABC Company. I understand that in order to become an account executive I would need to spend years as a sales rep. learning about and mastering the product you offer. The reason I am so passionate about becoming an account executive is because of the lifestyle that it offers. I intend to absolutely crush my sales quotas every month and bring in the big bucks for our company. I also love traveling and have always enjoyed a long sales cycle that involves tons of nurturing and dedication. Wining and dining potential clients on the company dime sounds pretty sweet to me! Of course, I know that I have to prove myself before I can have the job of my dreams.&rdquo; BOOM-Shakalaka! Mic dropped. Mind blown. Job Offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Be Strategic</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are truly interested in the position you are interviewing for, this question should be very simple to answer! If it is not something you are interested in, you may stumble or pause through your response. This is why it is so important to prepare before the actual interview. You must be strategic!

One very common interview question that you should prepare for is \"Why should we hire you\"','<p>It&rsquo;s not every day that you will get called for an interview. When you do get a call, it&rsquo;s important that you know how to answer some basic questions. One very common interview question that you should prepare for is &ldquo;Why should we hire you?&rdquo; This question is very straightforward and direct, so it&rsquo;s important to dish it back in the same manner. There are just 2 things to be mindful of when answering this question. Avoid being too cocky, and avoid being too modest. There is a fine line between confidence and cockiness. If you are going to talk about how great you are, make sure you have proven metrics to back it up! Here are a few examples. Too cocky: &ldquo;Why should you hire me? I&rsquo;ll tell you why&hellip; I am the best in the world at what I do. I have never met another person who can do their job as well as me. Even my last manager did not have the skills that I have. I could have easily done his/her job. So, if you want the very best, hire me!&rdquo; Too modest: &ldquo;Well, I feel that I am pretty good at my job. I try really hard and I think that you will be happy with your decision if you hire me.&rdquo; Just right: &ldquo;You should hire me because I am a very fast learner and I know how to get the job done. I graduated college in 3.5 years, which is faster than any of my peers. In addition, I have worked all throughout college giving me a leg up on my competition. If you are looking to hire a recent grad, I can assure you that I will be able to learn faster and work harder than anybody else.&rdquo; <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-the-16-most-common-interview-questions\">How To Answer The 16 Most Common Interview Questions</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious to see that one is better than the others. Being overly modest never got anyone anywhere. And neither has acting obnoxiously cocky. Whatever personality type you are, try to find a happy balance when answering this question. The goal here is to reassure the employer that you are a great fit for the position, without doubting yourself or sounding arrogant.

Hopefully not, but most people who are in the workforce long enough will eventually have to deal with a conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Understanding The Question</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand the question you are being asked. This question doesn&rsquo;t imply that you were the one to start or instigate the problem, just that you had to deal with it. Maybe you sat quietly at your desk while people bickered around you. Maybe you were the mediator that solved the problem and found a fair resolution. Or maybe you were the instigator who caused the conflict at work. When someone asks you to describe a time you dealt with a conflict at work, the important part is the conclusion. How you dealt with the conflict. The employer is trying to get an idea of your conflict resolution skills. This will tell them a lot about your personality. Are you the type of person who just likes to stay out of it? Are you the type of person who likes to involve yourself and try to mediate? Or are you the type of person who likes to instigate conflicts and hold a grudge? If you want to be successful in the interview, you must focus on a conflict with a positive conclusion. Once you finish learning how to describe a time you dealt with a conflict at work, learn&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-the-16-most-common-interview-questions\">How To Answer The 16 Most Common Interview Questions.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>40&ndash;60 Rule</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you begin to explain the situation, spend only about 40% of your time on the actual problem and events that led up to the problem. The remaining 60% should focus on the actions that you took to deal with the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Here is an example&hellip;</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;At ABC Company I was assigned a task by a member of the engineering department. He needed help from myself and one other member of the marketing team to finish a web page design. Unfortunately, his deadline expectations were unrealistic for us.I had never met this individual since our departments were in separate buildings, so I asked to get together with him for lunch. I kindly asked him to walk me through his expectations for my role in this project. After he laid out his expectations, I walked him through the steps that we were taking to ensure the project was done accurately. Once we had the chance to learn about each other&rsquo;s processes, we had a much better understanding of the timeframes that were realistic. We agreed on a do-able timeframe that would help us both meet our goals and the conflict was resolved before it could escalate.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s Your Story?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody is going to have a unique story to tell. The worst thing you could do is not answer the question and say you have never dealt with a conflict. The employer would have no idea how you are going to react when a sticky situation occurs, or if you can even handle it. Remember, conflict is inevitable. The longer you are working, the more conflict you will see. It&rsquo;s how you deal with it that will show your true character.

But we can guarantee that the people you are competing against will say something along those lines. And to be honest, hiring manager love that kind of answer. This is why it is essential to choose your wording wisely when you describe your work style. If you follow the below guidelines, you will crush this question and leave the hiring manager wanting more!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Keep It Short And Sweet!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways to describe your work style and everything depends on the job description. You should pick a few specific characteristics that describe your work style and emphasize how they relate to the open position. This can be difficult as you may feel that many of your character traits apply. How do you narrow it down to be short and sweet!?The key to this question is to understand your strengths and be able to express these in a clear and precise way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Are You Organized?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Being organized is essential for your success in any position. The last thing your employer wants to hear is, &ldquo;Well, my plan for the first 3 months is to just wing it. I&rsquo;ll play it by ear.&rdquo; Being able to express your methodical organization used in your past positions shows the employer that he would have to train you on one less thing. Although organization is great, you should also spend a few sentences explaining your ability to adapt to changes. You wouldn&rsquo;t want your employer thinking you are going to have a fit if he throws a curve ball your way.

Unfortunately, 95% of jobs involve collaboration with other team members so you will probably need to emphasize that you are comfortable working with others. No matter how much of an introvert you are, at least for the sake of the interview, be a team player! It is also essential to express your ability to work alongside your supervisor. Some people are terrified to collaborate with their employer.Don&rsquo;t be!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Are You Dedicated?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not be the quickest to finish or the brightest in the bunch, but if you can show dedication, you set yourself apart from the average employee. We are not expecting you to put in 90-hour workweeks, but you must show you are willing to put in the work for a given position. Saying something along these lines will surely impress your employer. &ldquo;I am willing to show up early and stay late if the job isn&rsquo;t finished! I even spend a lot of my personal time at home researching our product and competitor products.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Close the Deal!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how you describe your work style, you shouldn&rsquo;t answer this question like a robot. You should be fully convinced that if offered the job, these are the qualities you will bring to the table. Just make sure to be confident in your answers and you will have no problem with this question. Don&rsquo;t second-guess yourself! The most important part of all is to make sure you read the job description and know it like the back of your hand. This is the only way you will be able to describe your work style in a way that is relevant to the position!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Example:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Question: How would you describe your work style? Answer: &ldquo;Over the years I have had the opportunity to work with one person more then anyone else&hellip; myself. Nobody knows me better then me. I have come to realize that there are three main things I possess that make me a great employee, and co-worker. 1) Organized. I plan my days very efficiently in order to get the most work done possible. However, I am also very adaptable in that I am always willing and able to stop what I am doing to focus on a higher priority task. 2) Team player. No one enjoys working with others more then me. I am always willing to help my fellow co-workers and eager to learn from my supervisors. Lastly, 3) Dedicated to my work. I take pride in the work I do and want to make sure that I do the highest quality work possible. I will work long hours, do research on my own time, and help improve this organization in any way possible.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you learned something from this article.

Believe it or not, the truth is not always the best solution.','<p>The&nbsp;question, &quot;Why are you leaving your job&quot; can be kind of awkward depending on your answer. Believe it or not, in this situation the truth is not always the best solution. For example, if you have a really crummy boss that you just can&rsquo;t stand working with anymore, it is not recommended to bad mouth anyone at your old company. This shows poor character on your part. Rise above the slander and find a better answer. Bad: My boss was horrible. He couldn&rsquo;t do anything right. I could do his job much better than him. Good: The work culture was not the best fit for me. I felt underutilized and like I was not being challenged anymore. So, I would love to move to an organization that challenges me in a positive way where I can continue to grow and develop in my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Turn Negative Into Positive</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of stating all the reasons that you are looking to leave your job, flip the question and explain the reasons why you are so excited to work at the new company. Throw a little flattery in the direction of the employer; they won&rsquo;t bite.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Question: Why are you leaving your job?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Answer: I am no longer being challenged. I continue to request more responsibility but we seem to be at a stand still. My day-to-day has become repetitive with very little room for growth. Your company is constantly growing and adapting and the employees seem to be learning something new every day. I would love nothing more than to work for a revolutionary company such as yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>A New Era Of Job Seekers</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, this is just between you and me, but if you haven&rsquo;t noticed, &ldquo;job hopping&rdquo; has become more and more common. I think this is awesome; old school employers tend to disagree. If you are not familiar with the term &ldquo;job hopping&rdquo; it is essentially the act of going from job to job within a short period of time, usually a couple years or less. More and more job seekers are flooded with opportunities and will quickly leave a company if they have an offer for higher pay, better benefits, etc. I don&rsquo;t blame them! Hiring managers who are somewhat aware of today&rsquo;s culture understand this. It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal anymore if you have worked at 3 different companies in 10 years. 20 years ago that was a huge deal! You would be considered disloyal, unemployable, and unprofessional. In other words, don&rsquo;t worry too much about this question. Why are you leaving your job? Because you feel like it! I would definitely focus on some more relevant questions.

Be honest and tell them all the vacation days you deserve and all your pet peeves so they can make sure you&rsquo;re comfortable&hellip; The last thing you would want is to end up at a company you are going to be miserable at. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not always that easy. The hiring manager is not asking you this question so that he can accommodate all of your requests. They are asking the question to see if you fit inside their already determined work environment. If you have a ton of interviews lined up and have no shortage of options, then go ahead and be very straightforward with what you are looking for, eventually, you will probably find something. For most people, this is not the case. If this is a company that you are extremely passionate about working at, you are going to want to mold your answer in such a way that it fits with their work environment. Your should tailor your ideal work environment&nbsp;to match their already determined work environment. That way, the hiring manager can feel confident that you are going to be happy. Here are a couple things to focus on when determining your ideal work environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Size Of The Company</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interviewing with Google or a local small business? If it is Google, nice work! Regardless of the size of the company, state why that company fits what you are looking for. If you are applying to a larger company, you may emphasize that job security is important to you. With a smaller company, state that knowing everyone&rsquo;s name allows you to feel connected and provides a family type bond. Your answer must involve what you already know about the company or you&#39;ll most likely not receive a callback.

Unfortunately, if that is what your career entails, you better sell it! Whether you&#39;re a young adult or a seasoned executive with 10 kids at home, your focus is landing this job. You need to portray that you are willing to work as long as needed to get the job done. Not too many people enjoy dressing up for work every day. However, if the dress attire at a given company is formal, explain how that promotes professionalism. If the company promotes casual attire, you should have no problem expressing your love for&nbsp;T-shirts and jeans!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Focus On Landing The Job</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you do your research on the company you are applying for (Most Don&rsquo;t!), you should be able to crush this question. Many people focus too much on giving an honest answer, and not enough on giving the best answer. Now, we are not saying to go to an interview and lie through your teeth, but put yourself in the employer&rsquo;s shoes for a second. Are you going to hire someone who says that they prefer working in a small office when this job is in a huge 500-person office? You would actually be doing this person a disservice by offering them a job they probably would not be happy at. To sum it up, if you really want the job you will suck it up and make what they offer you your new ideal work environment.

Better yet, you should know the answer to this question before you even start applying for jobs. Imagine all the time you would save applying to jobs if you could eliminate 50% of them just based off the company culture. By spending some time up front, you will not only save time applying, but you will be very confident in an interview when asked what kind of a company culture are you most comfortable with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Innovative vs. Structured</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When determining a company culture that would be a good fit, there are really only 2 main categories to worry about. <strong>Innovative:</strong> Many startups are known for the type of culture that they provide. Google was the first company to really take this seriously and since Google, everyone else has tried to copy them. If you go to Mountain View, CA and check out the Google facility you are going to see just about everything. From bicycles, massage stations, restaurants, and work pods, to outdoor offices, gyms, and hangout areas,&nbsp;Google has it all. Google has pioneered the idea of an ideal company culture. They take care of their employees and provide them with the freedom to be creative and happy, and in return, Google employees produce the highest quality work. That is their approach. However, some people prefer a more calm, structured company culture. <strong>Structured:</strong> Many organizations that have been around for a very long time such as UPS could be considered extremely structured. There is a strict hierarchy at UPS. Seniority will always outweigh productivity. One big positive is that job stability at these types of organizations is extremely high compared to a start-up company. Structured organizations have a set way of doing things and a proven method that works, so why change it? Change is very hard to come by in these types of organizations. As an employee, you are really not incentivized or inspired to think outside the box of your job description. After this article, learn <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-the-16-most-common-interview-questions/\"><u>How To Answer The 16 Most Common Interview Questions</u></a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How To Choose</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do you choose? There are a few questions that you should ask yourself to see which type of a company culture you would fit in best with. 1) Do you enjoy frequent change? 2) Would you consider yourself a creative worker? 3) Do you enjoy interacting with people? 4) Would you like your work to be a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; place or do you prefer your fun to be outside of work? 5) Do you believe productivity should outweigh seniority? If your answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo; to most of those questions, then you would probably enjoy working at a company with a startup-y culture. Just to clarify, Google is far from being a startup and they offer this amazing culture that all the top startups are copying. You do not need to be a startup company in order to have this kind of culture. There are plenty of large organizations that offer this sort of company culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Stick To Your Guns</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important that when you are evaluating a company to apply for, you do some research to determine what kind of a company culture is offered. At the end of the day, stick with your preference and be honest about the type of company culture you would enjoy the most. The last thing you want to do is get stuck at an organization that you really are not going to enjoy 1 year down the road.

Here are some common interview mistakes - and how to avoid them.','<p>An interview is all about giving a potential employer the opportunity to evaluate you. And judge you they do! You&#39;re going to be held to a very high standard of performance by your interviewers. Here are some common interview mistakes - and how to avoid them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Showing Up Late</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you arrive after your appointed time, it&#39;s pretty likely that you won&#39;t get the job - even if the interviewers still agree to meet with you. If you&#39;re late, the interview team will elevate their expectations of you that much higher. They will expect you to &quot;wow&quot; them; anything less will be a failure because you&#39;ll already have a major demerit in your column to overcome. <strong>Solution</strong>: Leave early for the interview, allowing plenty of time for traffic snarl-ups, road closures, or other delays. Don&#39;t believe Waze, even if it tells you you&#39;re going to get there in plenty of time &ndash; the unexpected happens; it&#39;s better to allow extra time to sit in your car listening to Nickelback on the radio before heading up to the interview rather than cutting it close.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Dressing Inappropriately For The Interview</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In doing your research about the company culture, you find out that everybody there wears jeans to work every day. You show up to the interview in your dungarees and a polo shirt. When you arrive in the lobby, you spot some other job seekers wearing their finest suits. Whoops. <strong>Solution</strong>: Always, always, always wear a suit to the interview. Don&#39;t assume that because it&#39;s a casual work environment that the interviewers will judge you any less harshly for your unprofessional attire. If you get there and the interviewer tells you to take off your jacket and tie, then, of course, feel free to shed them. But unless the person setting up your interview specifically tells you not to wear a suit to the interview, dress to impress. For a more in-depth look check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/preparing-for-a-job-interview-what-to-bring-what-to-wear-and-more\">Preparing For A Job Interview &ndash; What To Bring, What To Wear, &amp; More.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Failing to Acknowledge All The Interviewers</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ll likely meet several people during the interview. Directing your attention toward one interviewer and ignoring another could inadvertently send the message that you&#39;re playing favorites, and might tick off an interviewer who feels neglected. <strong>Solution:</strong> Treat everybody who interviews you (or greets you, for that matter) with the utmost attention and respect. If it&#39;s a panel interview (they&#39;re all around the table evaluating you), make sure you make eye contact with and speak to everybody. And when you&#39;re sending out &quot;thank you&quot; notes afterward, make sure everybody gets one. Even the receptionist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Answering Interview Questions Poorly</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t understand the context of the question, and you give a wrong answer. Or you fail to give enough detail in your response. Or you just don&#39;t know what to say, so you wing it. The interviewer is, suffice to say, unimpressed. <strong>Solution</strong>: Be prepared; bring a page of notes of topics to discuss. If you don&#39;t understand the question, ask for clarification. If you&#39;re caught off guard, ask the interviewer for a moment (literally, a few seconds) to gather your thoughts - they&#39;ll usually comply and think no less of you. Most importantly, know how to tell a story; interviewers ask behavioral interview questions (which usually start with, &quot;Tell me about a time...&quot;) about your past experiences to see how you&#39;ll handle similar situations in the future. Be prepared to walk the interviewer through your story using the <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result\">STAR Interview Model</a></strong> (it&#39;s an acronym): Explain the SITUATION you encountered, then the TASK you had to address, the ACTIONS undertook to deal with the situation, and the RESULT of your actions. It&#39;s best to give stories that have a happy ending, and if it&#39;s not a happy ending, add a LEARNING from the negative situation. And do your research on the company; this is when it&#39;ll come in handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Talking Too Much</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You answer the interview question. Then you keep yapping. The interviewer&#39;s eyes glaze over. Then he looks at the clock. And then his watch. Trust me, he&#39;s grasping for something to say that will end the conversation. <strong>Solution</strong>: Be aware of the length of your answers - if you&#39;re spending more than a few minutes answering a complex question, check your interviewer&#39;s body language to see if he is actively engaged in the information you&#39;re presenting, or looks like he&#39;s trying to politely hide his frustration or boredom. As a rule of thumb, if you&#39;re presenting a detailed story such as in a behavioral question, 3 to 5 minutes should be plenty for you to get the story out and leave time for follow-up questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6. Not Asking Questions</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a deal killer. Not asking questions during or at the end of an interview tells the interviewer you either don&#39;t care or weren&#39;t paying attention. I&#39;ve seen candidates ace an interview, only to lose the interviewers&#39; interest when they say they&#39;ve got no questions ready. <strong>Solution</strong>: Make sure to get a few questions in. They don&#39;t even need to be brilliant. Try, &quot;What does success in this role look like?&quot; or &quot;What are the biggest challenges the company faces in the next year?&quot; Leverage your research on the company to ask a pithy question about their business.

Because of my utmost confidence in my r&eacute;sum&eacute; writing skills,&nbsp;and expecting to land an interview, I faxed my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Sure enough, within 24 hours, my telephone rang. As expected, it was the employer who placed the ad. However, this call was not for an interview just yet. He called to insist on a separate document that I neglected to send in the first place&mdash;a cover letter. I was lucky that time because over the years I learned that there are many employers who will not consider you for a position if you do not include a cover letter in your response to their written job announcements. Especially if the announcements expressly request you to do so. Does it mean they will read your cover letter? Yes and no as it depends on the individual employer. My professional advice&mdash;do not take chances. Always send a well thought out, well-written, well-structured cover letter! As a certified professional r&eacute;sum&eacute; writer, I get queasy feelings when people ask me to write a cover letter for them unless they have a selected job in mind. That way, I can tailor the cover letter and create the appearance of a perfect match for the job. If you want to insult a potential employer, send a generic, one-size-fits-all cover letter. You are sending a message that you&#39;re not very serious about the position, and are only looking for a paycheck. The most effective cover letters are written to specific individuals at specific organizations targeting specific positions. If I write a cover letter for you, it is important that you tweak it to your voice. Give it your personality and let it exude your passion and ability to fit with the company&rsquo;s vision. No writer, not even Ernest Hemingway, can do that for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How do you write a cover letter that impacts employers in a positive light?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>1.Study the job announcement and tailor your cover letter to the announcement. Use the important keywords and phrases listed therein. 2.Browse the company&rsquo;s website, and find something that resonates with you. Reference it at the beginning of your cover letter as a motivating factor in your joining their team. Such a statement sends a loud resounding signal to the employer that you might be a good &ldquo;fit.&rdquo; Which employers value more than mere qualifications. 3.At the closing of your cover letter, affirm to the employers that you look forward to the opportunity to meet with them personally in a job interview. And always thank them for their time and consideration.

This understated theory has repeated itself throughout our college days of trying to nail that first exciting new role, and there&#39;s always new takes on how to present yourself in the best light. Yet Interestingly enough, I still run into on a consistent basis, a higher ratio of poorly executed resumes that do not make the cut. Or for that real matter, make it past the Email box of what an employer would consider, a &quot;catch&quot;, a &quot;runner&quot;, an &quot;A candidate&quot; to move forward. When I take the time to review such a resume, I see that given a second glance, the candidate could have been a possible top choice, but it was hidden under some very simple misguided resume blunders. I had a Clinical Pharmacist once with over 10 years of actual, hearty experience. However, my clients made up an excuse not to even screen him with the decency of a call. I had to ask why? They were turned instantly off by his last role, which had the title VP over it. They put him in the &quot;over-qualified&quot; category. Now this candidate had a story. He wanted to get back to a hands-on role. But no suitable pharmacy company would look past his resume, and in the end, they hired a new grad over his vast experience. It made me curious, so I asked him if you want a hands-on role, why the VP title? His reply, &quot;well I wanted to showcase that&quot;. I went on to explain to him that unless he was looking for his next step up, to possibly something larger than a VP, it was not serving him well presently. He agreed and made the changes. He landed a role shortly after. I am in a profession where it&#39;s not only my job to make you look presentable on paper but get you in the door for an interview. That way, you can bring yourself to life in the interview process and get that chance to have the clients fall in love with you. As a recruiter, I will also let you know when I think your resume could use a brush-up, a tweak, or a simplified new look. And I&#39;m not afraid to call you out on items that look weird or out of place or ask you why there was a change in career pattern or time gap. Believe it or not, I do this so that you can succeed! However, it&#39;s not always easy scanning and proofreading every resume that crosses me. What I see and what a prospective client sees can be vastly different. So, it&#39;s helpful to try and do the homework on your own first. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs/\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For Jobs.</a></strong> Here are a few of my recent recommendations to help you put your best foot in the door:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keep It Relevant</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most employers in today&#39;s market are looking for candidates with relevant experience that is also recent. If you want a position as a car salesman, and all of your sales experience dates back ten years ago, you could easily get overlooked. But then how does one bring up to date those talents without lying or making yourself out to be someone you&rsquo;re not? I find the newer models of resume templates have a nifty feature where skills are generally at the top of the page and it will catch the eye of the beholder to read on a bit further. Also, determine what you&#39;re looking for on your career path, and choose those roles that highlight that first.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Less Is More</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another latest issue is the length of a resume. While much can be debated whether it is important to add every single role, I have had candidates shoot me a five-page resume, and it is detailed to the point of exhaustion. There is no need for it truly. Like many headhunters out there, I use the analogy of dating someone. When you are actively dating, the same law applies; less is more. Hit the highlights, make an impact with a phrase or two under each job title, and then let the client want to inquire more and fall in love once they actually meet you. In dating, you may get a second chance, but this is not always the case on a piece of paper with your heart sprawled all over it. Generally, one to three phrases can cover it all. The client knows the keywords they are looking for. If they want to know how you,&ldquo;Managed the daily reports for several facilities,&rdquo; trust me they will ask you what system you used. A lengthy resume can also date you. It has become increasingly difficult to outdo the next generation and be seen for what you bring to the table. Keep the resume to the last relevant 3-4 roles you held. You can always share the story of when you were that MVP at that legendary company on the face-to-face interview or once you&#39;ve landed the role in the coffee room. Try to keep it on one to two pages&rsquo; maximum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stay Up To Date</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Always be up to date on your resume, and keep it safe for easy review. Go online. See what the latest resumes and versions hold. Check other resumes in your industry. Have a friend proofread it for their opinion. Ask your recruiter if it looks good or needs any adjustments. Lastly, my thoughts on colored resumes. Unless you are somehow in a profession that displays artistic values, i.e.; a designer or high tech software engineer, photographer, leave the crayons alone. It&#39;s too busy and distracting. I like the latest templates that just highlight your name as a good stand-out touch. Hope this helps you land that dream role!

Using LinkedIn in the job hunt will help...','<p>You&rsquo;ve heard one or more of these statements before, I&rsquo;m sure. &ldquo;Do you use LinkedIn?&rdquo; &ldquo;Update your LinkedIn profile.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t on LinkedIn, now is the time to start.&rdquo; These are all sentences that may very well have come your way if you&rsquo;re telling people you&rsquo;re currently in the market for a new position. And rightfully so. LinkedIn is without a doubt the most beneficial social media platform to you during this time. Why? Because realistically, your next job is going to come from your immediate network, and not from sending your resume into the abyss as you would on any run-of-the-mill job posting website. This is the crucial time when you need to be leveraging and expanding your current network in pursuit of your next opportunity, and LinkedIn is an invaluable tool to help you do that. Of course, simply having a profile isn&rsquo;t enough &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got to know how to enhance it and utilize it as a personal marketing tool. Here are some tips to help you bring your profile from &ldquo;Beginner&rdquo; to &ldquo;Expert&rdquo; in no time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Make a catchy professional headline</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what people are going to see when they search for your name, or if it pops up through mutual connections. If you were employed, this is where you&rsquo;d put what you do and where you work, but for the time being, don&rsquo;t sweat it. You can easily put that you&rsquo;re searching for a job, but you want to describe yourself in a way that&rsquo;s not only accurate but effectively positions you among your targeted employers. It&rsquo;s all in how you word it. Take mine, for example. &ldquo;Experienced Marketing Communications Professional Seeking New Opportunity.&rdquo; It describes me at face value: I&rsquo;m a marketing professional with experience, as you can tell by scrolling down my profile (more on that later.) The second part of it is that I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;looking for a job&rdquo;, but &ldquo;seeking new opportunity&rdquo;. See how much more polished that sounds? It also helps you to come across as an effective communicator. Again, word choice is very important, as you&rsquo;ll see as we move down your profile. For more on headlines, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/linkedin-headline-ideas-that-dont-suck/\">LinkedIn Headline Ideas That Don&#39;t Suck.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Upload a nice profile picture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure your profile picture is clean and professional and reflects the kind of professional you are, or wish to be. This means appearing in a presentable outfit with your best face forward. You don&rsquo;t have to smile, necessarily, but make sure you appear to be confident, secure and approachable. Next, make sure your face takes up most of the frame and appears before a clean, understated background. And please be the only person in the picture. It&rsquo;s nice for your potential employer to know that you have children or a significant other. It&rsquo;s also most likely irrelevant, because unless you&rsquo;re in a family business or partnership, your potential employer isn&rsquo;t hiring them &ndash; he/she will be looking at you. View our <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/5-tips-for-a-perfect-linkedin-profile-photo/\">5 Tips For A Perfect LinkedIn Profile Photo.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Write a complete summary</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the section where you describe yourself in no more than one or two paragraphs. What do you do? What are you looking for in terms of industry and desired position? Depending on the field you&rsquo;re in, you may want to add a few personal details about yourself. It&rsquo;s always great to add a human touch since this process can be very mechanized at times, and it&rsquo;s a good way for someone to know you beyond just a professional scope. Also, if you have a personal website or blog, or have written digital content such as an e-book or white paper, you can share it in this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. List your experiences completely and thoroughly</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where you list your work experience. Be sure to list all your past experiences and companies, as well as their locations and responsibilities for each. The more thorough you are with this section, the better, as it shows potential employers the full breadth of what you&rsquo;ve done. For each position, it&rsquo;s good to have at least four or five different responsibilities, if you&rsquo;re able to list them. And when you list your previous companies, be sure to connect each listing to the actual LinkedIn page for the company. Then you can get the company&rsquo;s actual logo on your page, which reinforces your legitimacy and adds a little more flair to your profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. List your skills and get endorsements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is incredibly important. Find at least ten things that you think you do very well and would make you attractive to a potential employer. Even if they&rsquo;re things like &ldquo;Microsoft Office&rdquo; or &ldquo;Microsoft Word&rdquo; or &ldquo;PowerPoint&rdquo;, list them. You never know what special skills your next employer might be looking for. Once you&rsquo;ve got your special skills down, seek endorsements from your connections. A great way to get them is to give them first &ndash; reciprocity is always best.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Participate in groups</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another wonderful way to make your presence known on LinkedIn is to join groups relevant to your desired career path and consistently participate within them. Between your college alumni association, trade associations, and other industry-specific groups, you should find more than enough communities in which to participate and engage. Try participating at least once a week &ndash; the more your face is seen, the more personal brand equity you can build for yourself and the better your chances are of being discovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Don&rsquo;t forget the other sections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you flesh out the other areas, too. - Education &ndash; schools, GPA, courses that you think are especially relevant to your desired field, activities in which you participated while in school - Additional Info &ndash; causes that are important to you, personal email address and social media links (there&rsquo;s also a space for these links at the very top of your profile) - Languages - Volunteer Experience &ndash; This is especially important because many companies are deeply ingrained within the fabric of their communities. It&rsquo;s great to get involved with community organizations if you aren&rsquo;t already since that demonstrates a mutual dedication to community service between you and your next employer. - Honors and Awards - Organizations For more tips on sprucing up your LinkedIn profile, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/19-essential-linkedin-profile-tips-for-job-seekers/\">19 Essential LinkedIn Profile Tips For Job Seekers.</a></strong> Those are some basic strategies to begin fleshing out your LinkedIn profile.

I had the opportunity to speak to several local job seeking type organizations in Fresno, CA. What I hear the most when talking with them is seekers hesitate to get out of their comfort zone. I challenge them with the question, &ldquo;Do you want comfort or a job?&rdquo; My first tip for the shy job seeker is to create a description of their &ldquo;Ideal&rdquo; employer so that when they get out of their comfort zone and into a networking situation, they can quickly share their &ldquo;Ideal&rdquo; employer story with another. I encourage them to go to as many networking events, groups, and organizations as possible and share who they are, why they are there, and what they want to find. Of course, this takes a bit of time to prepare, practice, and deliver. Syntheses: My best tip for the shy job seeker is to prepare a few killer questions to ask another when meeting them for the first time so that the other person does all the talking. All the shy job seeker has to do is ask the next question.

He was disrespectful and completely unqualified... answer the interview question what do you think about your previous boss.','<p>&ldquo;Well, to be honest, my previous boss was TERRIBLE! He was disrespectful and completely unqualified to run the branch&hellip; He is a big reason I am here today seeking a new career.&rdquo; That is an example of how NOT to answer the interview question what do you think about your previous boss. Can you relate? Chances are, you are going to have a supervisor that you don&rsquo;t like throughout your career. But whatever you do, DO NOT word your response like the above statement. If you follow the below guidelines, you will be able to navigate through this cryptic question. Your response gives the hiring manager a fairly accurate picture of the type of employee you will be!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><em><strong>&ldquo;If You Can&rsquo;t Say Anything Nice, Don&rsquo;t Say Anything At All&hellip;&rdquo;</strong></em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This saying holds true to this question, but unfortunately, you have to say something! If you spew a bunch of complaints and past disagreements you had with your boss, this will most likely have a negative impact on your interview. Most companies have that overly critical employee that states he or she can do a much better job. Even if you are not this type of person, a negative answer can portray you as such. You should be able to spin any character traits or performance of your previous boss in a positive light. If you can&rsquo;t, stick to the basics such as: &ldquo;He was goal oriented and this helped me focus and crush my sales quotas and deadlines!&rdquo; &ldquo;She really allowed her employees to use their strengths to accomplish their tasks. She did not micro-manage each position, which helped create a high level of self-confidence for my coworkers and me!&rdquo; This interview question is very similar to &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/who-was-your-favorite-manager-and-why/\"><u>Who Was Your Favorite Manager And Why</u></a></strong>&rdquo; so we recommend you check this out after.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Put It Into Numbers!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, regardless of how your previous boss performed, there was a certain amount of success that you can quantify. It is always helpful to use percentages and dollar figures in your interview. If you do not have any known facts or statistics that you can share in your response, we would suggest not making them up. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t make up outlandish numbers as this will be a dead giveaway that you are lying!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>This Question Is About You!!!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter your feelings towards your previous employer, there is a right and wrong answer to this question. A successful candidate will use this question to highlight their accomplishments and their personality traits that align with the open position. Although this question involves another person, you should always redirect the conversation to discuss why you are the right person for the job! If you had a great boss prior to the interview, you should have no problem avoiding the pitfalls of this question. Make sure to keep it professional rather than describe why your boss was your best pal. You are reading this for a reason, so if it&rsquo;s to prepare, make sure you prepare a response to any question relating to your previous employer. YOU GOT THIS!!!

When determining who was your favorite manager and why you must approach this question correctly as it is a fairly easy opportunity to shine!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Choose One Of Your References!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Picking one of your references should help instill confidence with the employer as he can validate your response if necessary. If you did not already have your favorite manager on your reference list, add them! Whether or not this person is in a relevant industry to the position you&rsquo;re applying for, it is OK to use one of your references to validate your character rather than the job description.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Stay Classy!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t ever talk about a previous manager/supervisor in a negative way. Even if what you say is true, the hiring manager will immediately classify you as a negative employee. Not to mention, why would you be speaking negatively about your favorite manager?! You should take this same approach when answering <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/why-are-you-leaving-your-job/\">Why Are You Leaving Your Job?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Add In Your Accomplishments</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although you are discussing another person, this is a great opportunity to highlight your accomplishments while working under this manager. Whether this manager helped you hit your sales quotas or allowed you independence, fit that in your response. Pick accomplishments you can quantify by adding percentages or dollar figures as that is what employers love to hear!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Relate Your Response To The Current Job Description</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Picking character traits that are needed in the job description of the position you are applying for is a great move! This will again indirectly highlight your qualifications for the position. You can relate this to the question by stating that your favorite manager was the one who taught you these relatable traits. Even if you need to stretch the truth a little to make this happen, that is fine. Just make it believable! <strong>Bonus</strong>: If you can add something that involves the company culture of the company you are applying for, that is great as well!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Don&rsquo;t Forget to Close!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you keep this professional and relate your response to the open position, you should crush this question! Don&rsquo;t explain why a manager was one of your friends, but more why they were a mentor to you. Clich&eacute;s are terrible for a reason so don&rsquo;t open with &ldquo;Well, George was a really friendly guy and we had great conversations at the water cooler&hellip;&rdquo;. Plan out your answer ahead of time and modify it so that it relates to the current company you are applying for. Good Luck!

You will learn why your resume should look good & how to make it visually stunning.','<p>Your professional r&eacute;sum&eacute; is your opportunity to sell yourself on paper. And even though the content is king, aesthetics plays a key part in the overall presentation of your qualifications as well. Similar to how companies create marketing collateral to accentuate their corporate brand in the marketplace, strategically selecting specific fonts, styles, layout, content and design elements, you must visually accentuate your brand to remain competitive in the job market. Not only should you create a compelling value-based r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but incorporating key visual components are important as well. First impressions are lasting impressions and if your r&eacute;sum&eacute; looks rudimentary, you likely won&rsquo;t be taken as seriously &ndash; which could mean a direct hit to your salary potential. Putting some thought and effort into creating a fine document that showcases your value while enticing the reader, your perceived value could immediately rise. Not to mention, after viewing hundreds of resumes on a daily basis, recruiters are inundated with mediocre, lackluster documents. So, help them help you and offer an exciting document that is not only strong in content, but aesthetically pleasing as well. Here are a few tips to help you make your r&eacute;sum&eacute; visually pop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Pick the right font</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Fonts do matter. In fact, there was a recent article by The Huffington Post, where Times New Roman was coined, the sweatpants of fonts and Comic Sans was considered a no-go unless you were applying to clown school. Although comical, this shouldn&rsquo;t be taken lightly. People are actually being overlooked for career opportunities because of bad font choices! I personally love a light and a fresh page with clean lines, so sans serif fonts like Calibri Light, Arial, Candara, Gill Sans and Century Gothic are some of my faves. For a more traditional look, I recommend a Cambria, Calisto, Garamond or Book Antiqua. Depending on the font style, your size should be somewhere between 10 and 12 points. (I teach more about this in my 12 Days of Resumes Video Training Series in my <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/brilliantprofessionistas\">private FB group</a> for professional women.) Anyway, depending on the look and feel you&rsquo;re going for, settle on a font that matches the tone of the r&eacute;sum&eacute; and complements your personal brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Create the perfect amount of white space</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact is, no one is truly reading your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. In fact, studies show recruiters only take an average of 6 seconds to skim the information for content they are looking for. So, it is critical that your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is easy on the eyes and inviting to read. Creating just the right amount of space in strategic locations on the page can help balance text from open space. If there isn&rsquo;t enough white space, your document will look too dense and no one will even attempt to read it and your resume will sadly make a swift transition to the NO pile. On the other hand, if there is too much white space, your r&eacute;sum&eacute; looks rudimentary and scant. So, keep margins between .7 and .5 on all sides and avoid placing headers in the left column (see screenshot below). <img alt=\"why_resume_one\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4406\" src=\"/uploads/why_resume_one.jpg\" style=\"height:776px; width:597px\" /> Another strategy is to be reasonable with the amount of space between sections. There is no need for 2 lines worth of space between your experience and education, it&rsquo;s a waste of prime real estate. Make paragraphs no more than 3 to 5 lines and list no more than 3 to 5 bullets. Also, a great rule of thumb is to have either 1 full page or 2 full pages. Having only a few lines on page 2 makes it seem incomplete and may come off as tacky.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Use a splash of color</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Resumes, in general, tend to be boring and mundane. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to add some minor elements of color to give recruiters a breath of fresh air, but be careful not to take it overboard. Pick subtle shades of blue to play it safe or move into hues of purple, orange or even green. It gives life to the page and stimulates the eye. Here&rsquo;s a quick example of a r&eacute;sum&eacute; I was able to create using green. <img alt=\"finance_executive\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4407\" src=\"/uploads/finance_executive.jpg\" style=\"height:447px; width:731px\" /> You can add color to your name, lines, bullets, headings and job titles, keywords. And use color to guide the eyes to some important selling points.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Add visual elements</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A great way to make your r&eacute;sum&eacute; stand out and look visually appealing is the use of images. Charts, graphs or boxes can break up text and add a delightful element to your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. A chart or graph plays a double role as it also helps convey information. In today&rsquo;s information overload, our attention span is at an all time low and pictures aid in taking in information. So, don&rsquo;t be afraid to create some sort of visual aid to help paint the picture that tells your career story.

Bullets need to line up and margins should be even on all sides. So, make sure bullets are the same size, color, and shape. Make sure your fonts are consistent throughout. Remember, it&rsquo;s all about the presentation ;-) Think about this, a meal that looks amazing will be more enticing than a sloppy plate. So, make sure your plate isn&rsquo;t sloppy- make your r&eacute;sum&eacute; Look Good! Also keep in mind that some of these elements (particularly the images) may not mesh well with online application systems, so I recommend creating a separate r&eacute;sum&eacute; without all the bells and whistles to upload online. But, if you&rsquo;re doing a more direct self-marketing strategy, emailing a polished r&eacute;sum&eacute; directly to a recruiter or your future boss will take you far.</p>','why_resume_one.jpg','2016-12-24 11:40:54','why-your-resume-should-look-good-and-how-to-make-it-visually-stunning','Why Your Resume Should Look Good & How To Make It Visually Stunning','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(45,1,'Are You Interviewing With Any Other Companies?','This is the best solution 99% of the time. When being asked if you are interviewing with any other companies your answer should always be....','<p>This is one of my all-time favorite interview questions to answer. The answer may surprise you or contradict other things that you have heard, but I can assure you, this is the best solution 99% of the time. When someone asks if you are interviewing with any other companies your answer should always be YES! There are 3 main things that happen when you admit to interviewing with other companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Sense Of Urgency</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By admitting that you are interviewing with other companies this creates a sense of urgency with the recruiter or hiring manager you are interviewing with. Every company has a different hiring process with unique steps to move forward, but these steps can almost always be fast-tracked for the right candidate. I have been on countless interviews where I was interviewing with other companies and the hiring manager&#39;s schedule all my interviews within days of each other so that they could finish all my interviews in 1-2 weeks. Normally this process would have taken over a month to complete. Why did they do that? Because they knew I was interviewing at other companies and they wanted to swoop me up before someone else did! This brings me to the next point&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Recruiter Reassurance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about it. These personality traits go all the way back to Kindergarten when you were playing with toys at lunch. When the toy is on the ground, nobody wants it. But the second someone else picks that toy up to start playing with it, you immediately want it! It&rsquo;s human nature for us to desire things that other people have. When somebody else is interviewing you, it reassures the recruiter that you must be a solid candidate, especially if they are for similar positions. The more relevant companies you are interviewing with, the more jealous and competitive the recruiter is going to get. They are going fight for you, pull strings for you, work on your resume for you, and do whatever it takes to win you over. That puts you in a pretty nice situation. Before your next interview make sure to know the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">50 Top Job Interview Questions And Answers</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Leveraging Your Salary</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When it really comes down to it, interviewing at multiple companies is going to dramatically help you leverage your desired salary. Do you think a company is going to negotiate intensely with someone who has absolutely no other job offers on the table? They are probably thinking that you have nowhere else to go and you are going to accept whatever offer they give you. They are right! Interviewing with other companies gives you the opportunity to cause some friendly competition between the companies. You can guarantee that your starting offer will be higher and your negotiation will be much easier if you are interviewing with other companies. For more on salary negotiation check out, <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-salary-expectations/\">What Are Your Salary Expectations?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Technicalities To Watch</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>-Don&rsquo;t list irrelevant companies in different industries, positions, etc. (I have made this mistake). -Rewording: Only list relevant companies. This means, if you are applying for a sales position, don&rsquo;t mention that you are interviewing for a warehouse job. This will make the hiring manager doubt that you are really passionate about the sales position. -Continue to express interest in the company you are interviewing at. Don&rsquo;t tell them you are interviewing at 5 other companies that you like more. If you are interested in the company, keep leading them on and let them know that you are very excited about their particular opportunity above the rest. If you have no interest or intent to work there, don&rsquo;t lead them on, that is super annoying! In conclusion, it is always a great thing to mention that you are interviewing at other companies. By answering if you are interviewing with any other companies correctly you will get hired faster, build up the hiring manager&#39;s confidence in you, and make a few extra bucks!

Did you say “nope, no questions.” Or did you ask a question that maybe you wish you never asked?','<p>This is one of those guaranteed interview questions that can be very tricky to perfect. Without a doubt, you have already been in an interview where someone asked you &ldquo; Do you have any questions for me? &rdquo; Did you freeze up? Did you say &ldquo;nope, no questions.&rdquo; Or did you ask a question that maybe you wish you never asked? Whatever the case is, after reading this article you are going to be able to answer this question like a seasoned pro! I am going to break down this answer into two categories, 1. For the inexperienced interviewee, and 2. For the more advanced interviewee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Inexperienced Interviewee</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are new to the whole interviewing process then I highly recommend that you prepare for the interview in advance with some well thought out questions that you could ask the interviewer. Write them down on your notepad and bring them into the interview. - What do you love most about this company? - What kind of a career roadmap can I expect in this position? - What&#39;s the biggest struggle amongst members of this team? - What&#39;s the most rewarding part of your day? - What would you expect of me in terms of performance on a day-to-day basis? Avoid making your first question about pay, benefits, perks, etc. If your first question is about pay, the hiring manager is going to think that that is all you have been thinking about the entire time. Show interest in the company and the position by asking a question like the ones above. For more entry-level advice learn <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-entry-level-jobs/\">How To Apply For Entry Level Jobs</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Experienced Interviewee</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For my more experienced interviewees, being asked do you have any questions for me is going to set you apart from your competition. Don&rsquo;t walk in with a list of generic questions, that&rsquo;s what everybody else is going to do. Instead, actually pay attention throughout the entire interview. When the hiring manager says something that is interesting to you, or you can tell it is something that he/she is very passionate about, take a mental note of this. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to shine. When you are asked if you have any questions, let them know that you are interested in learning more about whatever topic they brought up during the interview. By expressing your interest in something that was important enough for them to bring up during the interview, you are sure to hit a sweet spot with the hiring manager. You will score points by showing that you were paying attention and that your interests align with those of the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>P.S. We Love You</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you are a pro at answering &quot;Do you have any questions for me&quot;, it&rsquo;s time to put your knowledge into practice! Hopefully, at this point, you already have a ton of interviews lined up, but if not, we would be more than happy to help get you on the right track.

Chances are that even if you haven’t yet, you will someday...','<p>Have you ever been asked the question how would your friends describe you in an interview? Chances are that even if you haven&rsquo;t yet, you will someday. It&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry when preparing for your interview. Now, this may seem like a really obvious answer, but the best thing to do is actually ask your friends how they would describe you. You can save yourself from clinical depression and ask them to only share the nice things they think about you. This will not only be a great way to have an honest answer in the interview, but it also might make you feel good and bring you closer to your friends!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Be Positive</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, you have taken the advice from above, and you are asking your friends to tell you some positive things that describe you. You absolutely do not want to tell a recruiter or hiring manager bad things about yourself! If your friends would describe you as a selfish jerk, DO NOT say that in your interview. This seems pretty obvious, right? Sadly, I have heard people joke around in an interview and say that their friends would describe them as the &ldquo;best beer chugger&rdquo; or &ldquo;a lady&rsquo;s man&rdquo;. Neither of these answers is going to be appropriate for the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Stay Relevant</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have yet to notice from reading other interview articles, relevance is going to play a huge factor. You can have the most awesome feedback from your friends, but if it is not relevant to the job, it&rsquo;s wasted breath. Make sure to tailor how your friends describe you to the job you are applying for. If you are applying for a customer service job, your answer could be &ldquo;All my friends describe me as extremely helpful. They know that I am always eager to help people and solve problems so they come to me anytime they need help. They would also say that I am a great communicator, very patient, and kind towards others even when they are not kind back.&rdquo; For a sales person, maybe your answer would be &ldquo;My friends know that I am always very outgoing and energetic. I am determined and never give up. One time, we were all rock climbing and about half way up everybody wanted to turn around and go back down the mountain. I turned our climb into a competition and proposed a $100 prize for whoever was first to climb the mountain. That quickly changed their minds and we decided to keep climbing. Side note, I won the $100!&rdquo; See<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-the-16-most-common-interview-questions\">How To Answer The 16 Most Common Interview Questions</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Tell A Story</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of these are considered great answers to the question how would your friends describe you. Both answers will work just fine, but in my opinion, the second one is better than the first. Why? Because I told a story. Anytime you can support your answer to an interview question with a story, you are going to set yourself apart from the crowd and give the interviewer something unique to remember you by.

Leveraging the hidden job market through online activities....','<p><strong>ATTENTION JOB SEEKERS: Are you overlooking hidden jobs and missing online opportunities? What&rsquo;s YOUR online job seeker &ldquo;IQ?&rdquo;</strong> As a career advocate (coach and recruiter), I speak to many disheartened, disenchanted, frustrated, and yet ― hopeful job seekers who are genuinely trying to find suitable work. A disproportionate number of them are hitting a wall after expending a great deal of energy. Or at a minimum, are encountering seemingly impassable roadblocks. It&rsquo;s often said that &ldquo;knowledge is power,&rdquo; but I subscribe to a different school of thought. From my perspective, knowledge plus action (and a bit of good timing and luck) can often make all the difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Numbers Don&#39;t Lie</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many activities into which those in transition can engage, but not all activity equals productivity. Unproductive job search activities conjure up an image in my mind of a hamster on a treadmill ― getting nowhere, fast. For instance, depending on the study, 66 -&nbsp;88% of job seekers land jobs with the help of a network. Knowing this, why don&rsquo;t more job seekers spend a greater amount of time networking? The most common answers are that networking is uncomfortable for many, is highly unpredictable, and takes a fair amount of work, not to mention, skill. Still, there&rsquo;s no denying the statistics, so networking should be a key job search activity. The same applies to LinkedIn. There are still too many job seekers who deny the statistic that a compelling percentage of recruiters, HR folks, and hiring managers are searching LinkedIn for candidates (87%, per the June 2016 Jobvite study). Why then, aren&rsquo;t all job seekers on LinkedIn? And why aren&rsquo;t those who are LinkedIn members maximizing the tools and functionality ― especially the free ones?!? In today&rsquo;s job market, you must remain ahead of the curve, and some of the best ways to accomplish this are to leverage the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SOME ONLINE IDEAS TO HELP JOB SEEKERS BECOME JOB SAVVY:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; LinkedIn Profile:</strong> Do you have one? <strong>&bull; Optimize Your Profile:</strong> Is your profile optimal with the right keywords in the right places to attract recruiters/hiring managers/others who may want YOU to be in THEIR network or those whom YOU want to be in YOUR network? <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>Outreach:</strong>&nbsp;Are you reaching out to LinkedIn power bases? BOTH Open Link members (with paid Premium accounts ― many of whom allow you to send them a free Inmail) and L.I.O.Ns (LinkedIn Open Networkers with 500+ 1st connections)? <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>LinkedIn Endorsements:</strong> If your top 10 shown are NOT in-line with your target job, write to those who can confirm your skills. Ask them to endorse those skills to get them to appear as your top 10. (Note that endorsements can be reordered in the editing function. It&rsquo;s best to ensure that enough of those in your LinkedIn network are endorsing the skills you wish to display first.) <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>What&#39;s Your Networking Quotient?</strong> Do you have a mix of those you KNOW WELL and those who are WELL NETWORKED? Experts agree that you need both. What is your GOAL mix comfort level? (90/10? 80/20? 70/30?) <strong>&bull;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Network Building:</strong>&nbsp;Are you PURPOSEFULLY AND TACTICALLY building your network with weekly network growth goals (e.g., inviting 20 new contacts every week)? <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>Keeping Pace With Your Industry:</strong> Are you &ldquo;Following&rdquo; BOTH your target companies and laser-focused individuals on LinkedIn? Doing so provides relevant news feeds and evidences your ongoing interest in keeping up with the latest news, jobs, etc. Are these VISIBLE on your homepage? (Recruiters and hiring managers look for/notice these things.) <strong>&bull; Industry Specific URLs:&nbsp;</strong>In addition to mainstream job boards, are you regularly scheduling and conducting searches on laser-focused industry-related or job-specific websites? <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>Attach Work Samples On LinkedIn:</strong> Include contact info so recruiters can contact you easily. You can also attach your resume on LinkedIn (For those with multiple resumes, this may not be advisable.). <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>Job Boards/Resume Repositories:</strong>&nbsp;Be sure to update/refresh your resume on LinkedIn.com, Monster.com, Careerbuilder.com, Indeed.com, ZipRecruiter.com, GlassDoor.com, etc., as this will attract attention. <strong>&bull; Indeed.com:</strong> Tip #1: Are you aware that recruiters can see your resume on Indeed.com, even if they do NOT have a paid subscription? Click on &ldquo;Find Resumes&rdquo; in the upper left, and type your name as well as your zip code. Does your current resume appear? Tip #2: Since Indeed removes contact information from the top of your resume, you can list an email address and/or your LinkedIn profile address elsewhere on your resume to best ensure that you get a call. (Indeed also may still offer you the option to edit your profile/resume after you upload it and if so, you can list your phone number.) <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>Set Up Job Agents (Alerts) On Major Sites</strong>&nbsp;and on your target companies&rsquo; website career pages. <strong>&bull;</strong> <strong>Network Settings (on LinkedIn and other career sites):</strong> Are they set properly? Is your activity feed active? Is your profile visible or private? Make sure your settings on all social network sites are set properly. <strong>&bull; Is It Apparent You Are Open To Opportunities?</strong> Do you state in your headline, summary, or elsewhere that you are &ldquo;exploring,&rdquo; &ldquo;seeking,&rdquo; or &ldquo;looking&rdquo; for other opportunities? Or do you state what you are doing on an interim basis? <strong>&bull; What Does Your Status Suggest?</strong> Do you state that you are a consultant? If so, a recruiter or hiring manager may pass on you believing that you are settling into a consulting career. If you are not, try, &ldquo;Interim Consultant&rdquo; or &ldquo;Currently taking on consulting assignments while seeking suitable full-time work.&rdquo; <strong>&bull; How Accessible Are You Online?</strong> Do you display some LI groups so that recruiters can message you through the group? Better yet, do you have a dedicated job search email and phone number (If not, go to Google and register for a new email and a FREE Google Voice phone number to use strictly for your job search.) Be sure to list your contact info in two places on your profile (&quot;Summary&quot; and &ldquo;Additional Information, Advice for Contacting&rdquo; you). So, how online savvy are you? And more importantly, how much MORE savvy will you be by implementing any of the ideas above that are new to you? I suggest that you prioritize the above list and begin chipping away at it. Although there is no one &ldquo;silver bullet,&rdquo; these ideas work and are highly productive job search activities. Those who are serious about achieving employment sooner rather than later will greatly benefit by systematically heeding the above advice.

When determining what are 3 positive things your last boss would say about you, it is important not to just spout off the first 3 things that come to mind. If you are reading this article before your interview then you are on the right track! You should have plenty of time to craft your answer specific to the job you are applying for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Quick Tips</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>-Don&rsquo;t exaggerate. The person doing your interview has most likely heard a ton of answers for this question before. Be honest, and avoid raising any red flags through seemingly unrealistic answers. -Be unique. Try to bring something to the table that nobody else can. What makes you special or particularly fit for this position? -Don&rsquo;t state obvious facts that are already on your resume. Your last boss should not be stating basic knowledge about your day to day. Instead, your last boss should mention work qualities and achievements that you possess. -Be modest. Whether or not it is true that you were the favorite of your last boss, do not put down others or diminish anyone when lifting yourself up. You can even do the opposite. Try crediting some of your success to your peers, boss, or someone else. Try relating this question to your strengths! Be prepared for the interview question, <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-strengths/\">What Are Your Strengths?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3 Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say &ndash; Example</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;During my last job, I was very well known for being the knowledgeable employee. I had memorized all of the content, statistics, and case studies for our company so everyone in the office would use me as their personal content encyclopedia. My boss also commented on how punctual I was - I never missed a deadline or was late to work for the 3 years I worked there. Finally, I would have to say that my boss would also bring up my team spirit. I was known for bringing in treats to the entire team after every successful event that took place. Everyone in the office looked forward to cookies or donuts after a huge sale, new product launch, or new milestone.&rdquo; If this example does not relate to you specifically, try your best to come up with your own. Below are a few basic traits that you can talk about. &bull; Trustworthy / Honest &bull; Great sense of humor &bull; Hard worker &bull; Willing to work extra hours &bull; Flexible &bull; Great under pressure &bull; Knows the profession &bull; Energetic</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>So What&rsquo;s Next?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are still unsure how to answer the question, &ldquo;what are 3 positive things your last boss would say about you&rdquo; then don&rsquo;t worry; we&rsquo;re here to help! <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a></strong> offers world-class <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/interview-training/\">interview training</a></strong> so that you succeed in your future interviews.

This question is one of the most important interview questions of all time. Not only will your answer impact your interview, but knowing what your dream job is will set you up for success throughout your entire career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Do Some Research</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s surprising how few people can answer the question, &ldquo;What is your dream job?&rdquo; There is not a right and wrong answer to this question since it is primarily an opinion. Your dream job may not be the same as someone else&rsquo;s, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it wrong. The first thing you need to do is determine your dream job. This does not have to be a position that you think you would qualify for right now. Figure out what your dream job is and then work backward to find a suitable job that will get you where you want to be. Once you have done that, you can begin applying for jobs based on the positions that are in line with your dream job. Set yourself apart from the competition. Learn <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online\">How To Apply For Jobs Online</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Stay Relevant</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important when you are applying for jobs that you stay relevant. If your dream job is to become a doctor, but you are applying for a sales position, that is not the best move to make. The sales manager interviewing you is going to be skeptical that you won&rsquo;t be happy at work when they know you want to be a doctor. Don&rsquo;t just apply to jobs to get any old job. It is going to take you more time, in the long run, to find your dream job if you are settling for less. Figure out what is your dream job and then research what it takes to get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Show Off Your Ambition</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short. Your dream job should be something that might take a few years to achieve. This depends on your current career level, but for most, you are still looking to climb the corporate ladder. Even if your dream job is something that you won&#39;t be qualified to do for another 10 or 20 years, it is great to have such long-term goals. Your next employer will love to hear how ambitious you are. The same goes when answering the question&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5-years/\"><u>Where Do You See Yourself In 5 Years.</u></a></strong> P.S. Don&rsquo;t confuse ambition with cockiness. Saying that you are going to be running the company in a couple years or taking somebody else&rsquo;s position is probably not the best idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Add Some Technicalities</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips that many people believe to be helpful when being asked what is your dream job in an interview. -Do not mention a specific job title. Instead, focus your answer on the qualities and tasks that this job would be responsible for. -If your dream job is many years away, mention that you do not expect to receive your dream job right away and that you understand it can take many years of hard work and dedication to get to where you want to be. -Do not lie and say that the current job you are applying for is your dream job. If it is, you should set higher goals for yourself. -Stay relevant! Saying a dream job that is completely unrelated to the job you are applying for might give your employer the impression that you will one day leave this job for another. -Take your time answering this question. No employer will punish you for taking a couple minutes to gather your thoughts. -Relate your dream job to the job you are applying for and express how this job will help you accomplish your dream. If the job is unrelated, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be applying. Don&rsquo;t settle!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&ldquo;What Is Your Dream Job&rdquo; Example:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;From birth, I have always been an animal lover. I like to make animals happy and find valid solutions to any problems that they are having. I thrive in environments that give me the opportunity to work using my problem-solving skills to provide them with the care they need. My dream job would be in a workplace where I was able to do this and work with animals as much as possible.&quot; Notice how I never mentioned a job title. I kept it open as to not eliminate myself for any great position that is not the exact title I mentioned. I hope this was helpful!

After all, you are interviewing for a position where you will be spending at least 40 hours a week together. It makes sense that they would want to know what kind of a person they would be working with. This question should not be difficult. Everyone has different hobbies and interests and sometimes, the unique hobbies are the coolest ones! Just because the person conducting the interview doesn&rsquo;t play the piano doesn&rsquo;t mean he doesn&rsquo;t greatly admire pianists. Don&rsquo;t be nervous, and don&rsquo;t lie! Let them inside of the real you, if even just for this one question.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mistakes To Avoid</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When answering what kind of things you like to do outside of work you definitely don&rsquo;t want to be unprofessional. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that all of your hobbies have to be work related. But they shouldn&rsquo;t be things that could have a negative impact on your work. For example, if a hobby of yours is that you like to go out on weekdays and party it up at the club, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t mention this since it could negatively impact your work the next morning. However, saying that you like to enjoy a beer after a long day of work or hang out with some friends is perfectly fine. Another mistake to avoid is being too vague. Don&rsquo;t just say,&ldquo;I love to travel, I like to invest money,&nbsp;I love to cook, I like watching TV, etc.&rdquo; Give details! Where do you like to travel? Who do you invest money in? What do you cook/favorite foods? What do you watch on TV!? Now that you are getting close to your interview, make sure you don&rsquo;t forget the essentials.

But I also spend a lot of time after work practicing songs or writing new music if I am bored.&rdquo; This is just one example. I recommend that you list 2-3 hobbies such as the one above, along with a little story that gives more information than just saying, &ldquo;I play the piano.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You&rsquo;re All Set!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Congrats, you are going to kick some bootie in your next interview.

This question can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare.','<p>Chances are if you are interviewing you will be asked the question where do you see yourself in 5 years. This question can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare. The trick to making this question your best friend is to have a well thought out answer before your interview. There are only 3 things you need to focus on when someone asks this question. Is your answer professional? Is it relevant to the job you are applying for? Does your answer express an interest in career progression?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keep It Professional</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When answering where you see yourself in 5 years the employer is not interested in hearing about your living arrangements, the number of kids you plan to have, or anything about your personal life. If this question is asked in a professional setting, it requires a professional answer. In other words, they are essentially asking &ldquo;Where do you see yourself <strong>in your career</strong> in 5 years?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keep It Relevant</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Relevance is key! This question, along with many other interview questions is somewhat of a trap. They are asking you where you see yourself in 5 years because they want to make sure that your goals are in line with those of the company. If you have expectations of where you will be in 5 years that the company cannot accommodate, that could be a red flag. It is important to align your goals to that of the company. Make sure to do research on the company before your interview! This will help you determine whether or not your long-term goals align.

If you show up to an interview and your answer to where do you see yourself in 5 years is, &ldquo;Well, if I get this job I see myself doing this job for the next 5 years&rdquo; you can guarantee you won&rsquo;t be getting an offer. Any employer wants to hire someone whose goals are to learn and grow as well as excel in his or her position. If you are unmotivated by personal growth or receiving a promotion within a 5-year period, you are not going to impress your employer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Where Do You See Yourself In 5 Years - Example:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My goal is to be the best at what I do and work somewhere where I&rsquo;ll have opportunities to learn and develop my skills, work on exciting new projects, and be a part of an amazing team who can coach me and help me grow. I believe that some of the most innovative creators work here and that&rsquo;s a big reason why I would love to start my future at XYZ Company.&rdquo; If you are still unsure where you see yourself in 5 years, or you&#39;re just having trouble articulating it, we&rsquo;d be happy to help.

In fact, I will never forget a bracelet that my sister once gave me with a charm on it that said:&ldquo;Let this be your greatest task, let this be your greatest joy, to give people back to themselves, even in their darkest hour, especially in that hour.&rdquo; This is how I look at my job. When someone comes into my office and tells me that they cannot do it or that they are not worth it, it is my job to help them see the possibilities and opportunities that are right in front of them. It all starts with a shift in their perspective and their vocabulary. I had one such situation recently with a job seeker who came in to interview with our office. He was a recent college graduate from a top school, but unfortunately, the school of life had given him some tough lessons before graduating. He shared with us that when he attended college, he was always comparing himself to everyone around him who seemed to &ldquo;have it together&rdquo; and &ldquo;be successful.&rdquo; Somewhere along the road, he told himself that he was not ever going to be &ldquo;that person,&rdquo; you know &ldquo;that successful person&rdquo; because of where he came from. His situation is not a unique one. I often have people who come to my office and struggle to even make eye contact during the interview because of fear, shame or uncertainty. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/bringing-a-winning-mindset-to-the-interview/\">Bringing A Winning Mindset To The Interview</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thoughts, Words, &amp; Actions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We started by looking at the disempowering words or phrases he was using in his interviews and in general conversations he was having. Some of those phrases included: I cannot I don&rsquo;t know I am not sure I tried Then we looked at his disempowering body language: Arms crossed Looking down Looking away Leaning back in his chair Next, we looked at the thoughts he was thinking as he was interviewing: I am not smart enough I come from a working class home Other people are smarter/better than me I don&rsquo;t have enough to show on my resume and/or in my background Once we were able to look at how his thoughts, words, and actions were aligning to create how he was coming across in the interview, we were then able to re-program his mindset to be an empowered mindset rather than a disempowered mindset. To create an empowered mindset we first replaced the disempowering words he was using with empowering words such as: I can I am I will We then replaced his distant body language with engaged body language such as: Open posture Uncrossed legs Slight lean in Strong eye contact</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Empowering Mindset Exercises</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we discussed exercises he could do to create an empowering mindset prior to any interview: Looking in the mirror and telling himself,&ldquo;You are the man! You got this!&rdquo; Creating a statement of intent that stated the job he would have, by when he would have it, and how much it would pay him. The last step was having him declare that statement of intent out loud first thing in the morning when he starts his day, as well as creating a positive intent prior to any interview. By reprogramming his words, thoughts, and actions, he now has access to landing his dream job effortlessly and with ease. These simple steps are something any job seeker can do to create an empowered mindset prior to any interview. Though your resume is important, it is your mindset that truly determines your success in landing the job of your dreams.</p>','Jennifer-Hill-1.jpg','2016-12-28 09:44:44','your-words-create-your-opportunities','Your Words Create Your Opportunities | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(54,1,'Interviewers: What Are They Looking For Anyway?','Have you ever wondered what interviewers are looking for in a new hire? In this article, we break down the 5 questions you should ask yourself when prep...','<p>Employers want to answer five major questions as a result of the interviewing process: 1. <strong>Can you do the job?</strong> (Skills and experience needed to perform the job) 2. <strong>Will you do the job?</strong> (Motivated to perform the job functions) 3. <strong>Will your performance have a positive impact on company goals?</strong> (Subjective predictions of future performance&hellip;&nbsp;will you be any good at it?) 4. <strong>Do you fit in?</strong> (Cultural fit) And, if you answer those four questions yes, then... 5. <strong>Are you affordable?</strong> (Compensation) When you answer all five of these questions affirmatively, you have a shot at the position. Other job seekers may pass the criteria, too. Failing to pass any one of these hurdles will result in the employer pursuing other job seekers for the opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Can You Do The Job?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the threshold question. Anything less than a clear and convincing &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this question results in you being by-passed for the position. Questions in this portion of the interview will be about your technical skills, ability, and knowledge, as well as your transferable skills and possibly your professional values. It is an evaluation of your qualifications for the job and a determination of whether you can actually perform the functions of the position. Emphasize your skills and abilities and match the basic elements needed to perform the job functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Will You Do The Job?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Motivation is pivotal to success in any job position and is a professional quality all hiring executives want to see in a job seeker. The hiring executive needs to know whether the job seeker is motivated to actually perform the job functions to levels required to be successful. This is an area where some hiring executives grumble about younger professionals. As a job seeker, you must convince the hiring executive that you have the required abilities and are motivated to use them! This is achieved by educating the hiring manager about your passion for the job, work ethic, internal drive, and examples of taking the initiative and going the extra mile. Revealing that you have researched the company, position, and perhaps the hiring executive&rsquo;s background can also be a reflection of your motivation. If the hiring decision comes down to two equally qualified candidates, the one that has demonstrated motivation and enthusiasm wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Will Your Performance Have a Positive Impact On Company Goals?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, the hiring executive will attempt to predict your future performance on the job, compare you to others who have been successful in the job, and other job seekers. You may have the necessary skills and be willing to use them, but will your performance have a positive impact and advance company goals? Will you be an improvement from the previous person in the position? Improve team performance, and so on? This is where competition for the position takes place in the mind of the hiring executive. It&rsquo;s about proving results and convincing the hiring manager that you can make things better. They want to hire the best! It is imperative during the interview to stress accomplishments, your history of success, and work ethic. Ask about how you will be measured in the position, position goals, and projects. Then reference your accomplishments to match and exceed expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Do You Fit In?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural fit with the organization and personal chemistry with those you will work with is a big deal. Statistically, 60 percent of new hires are based on personal chemistry. Employers tend to hire who they like even when more qualified candidates are available. Cultural and personal chemistry questions explore likeability, connection, communication, values, interests outside of work, and dress/appearance. When the hiring executive shifts gear into more personal topics, they are assessing your cultural fit and personal chemistry.

The more qualified you are and the more they like you, the more justification exists to move you to the higher end of that salary range. Sometimes, if your qualifications and cultural fit are strong enough, employers will go beyond the original compensation range to capture extraordinary talent. It does happen, but don&rsquo;t pursue positions in the hope that the employer will do so. All employers are conscious of budgets and parity issues. Let&rsquo;s conclude our discussion with the Strategy for a Successful Interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Strategy for a Successful Interview</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A successful interview strategy involves four reasonably simple concepts: 1. <strong>Uncovering the employer&rsquo;s need</strong>. You achieve this through reading job descriptions, listening, research, and asking probing questions. 2. <strong>Communicating to the employer that you can satisfy that need</strong>. You achieve this by matching and relating your skills and experience to the needs of the company. 3. <strong>Persuading the employer to hire you</strong>. You achieve this by emphasizing your past accomplishments and relating those accomplishments to the company&rsquo;s need. Not only can you do the job, but you can also do it well! Differentiate yourself. 4. <strong>Showing enthusiasm for the position</strong>. It is proven that top qualified candidates who show enthusiasm for the position are more successful in receiving job offers. Simply put, everyone wants to be wanted and the more you convince an employer you want the job, the more likely you are to get it.

Your resume should exhibit the passion for your new chosen path while revealing the abundant potential and current skills that you already possess. The following five recommendations should help you get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>It Begins With The Cover Letter</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As you begin your journey to start your new career, your first task is convincing hiring managers of your newfound passion. The purpose of a cover letter is not only persuading the hiring manager to read your resume but explain to them why you want to change careers. A great cover letter will convince the hiring manager about your desire for your new field and how it can be beneficial. You do this by explaining how your transferable skills and accomplishments will support the position and organization you are applying for. Your cover letter should be convincing enough for them to review your resume and contact you for an interview.

This resume format draws more attention to your transferable skills and accomplishments than your work history. Always start your resume with a professional summary to include your career goals and summary of your qualifications. After the career summary should be a list of accomplishments and transferable skills. These will give hiring managers a look at the most relevant experience to keep them interested. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/professional-resume-style-headers-fonts-and-themes/\">Professional Resume Style - Headers, Fonts, &amp; Themes</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Identify Your Transferable Skills</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transferable skills are skills obtained in previous work history that can also have an impact on your new career. These skills can be valuable to any profession or organization. Taking inventory of your skills can be used to your advantage such as; &bull; Manage multiple projects - this shows that you have the ability to multitask and can take on more than one project at a time. &bull; Communicate effectively with clients/customers - this highlights your relationship building skills and how well you communicate with individuals at various levels. It is important to remember that all jobs will have a learning curve when it comes to tasks. However, these skills show hiring managers what you have to offer despite your lack of professional experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Quantify Your Accomplishments</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Accomplishments can prove to be a tremendous asset to your resume, especially if you are changing professions. Quantifiable achievements show that you can make effective changes within an organization. Achievements should be very specific and include details such as; &bull; Did you improve a current process by increasing productivity? &bull; How did you help save the organization money on a project? &bull; Did you lead any projects or task force? Answers to these questions show your ability to lead, manage, and problem solve. It is also good to add numbers to your achievements especially if it includes employees, budgets, and money. Showing percentages and dollar amounts help the hiring manager visually see your efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Reinvent Yourself</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As you begin to reinvent yourself in your new profession, look into finding ways to gain more experience in your desired field. This experience shows hiring managers that you have a real passion for your new field and have a vested interest in developing new skills. For example, if your new career is in accounting, you may want to join a professional accounting association or take additional classes at a local community college. Another way to gain experience is to volunteer your time bookkeeping for a non-profit organization. These are great ways to expand your knowledge and gain reliable references. Regardless of where you gain the experience, it is still experience and valuable. You will also want to include this information in the professional summary on your resume. Changing directions in your career is entirely possible, especially in the current job market. Most individuals that change careers take advantage of industry changes that result in the lack of employment in some areas. The most important part of this journey is to focus. Focus on your passion and skills that you have always possessed. By focusing your skills, desire, and potential, it shows your enthusiasm that will lead you to an interview.

If your last project was a disaster, move on to the next one.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tip #1: Do not mention a project that does not have a positive outcome.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to have one main project that is your go-to project to bring up when being asked this interview question. What you don&rsquo;t want to do is tell the story in the same way for every position. Every hiring manager and company have different things they are looking for in a candidate: different skills, personalities, and experiences. Make sure to take a look at the job description and figure out what seems to have the most weight. If you absolutely cannot mention any recent examples of a project that was successful, you can resort to saying a failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tip #2: If you must mention a failed project, make sure you can explain why it failed and what you learned.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers\">50 Top Job Interview Questions And Answers</a></strong> for more interview magic!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Establish The 5 Ws &amp; 1 H Format</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody calls this the &ldquo;5 Ws&rdquo; format but I refuse to discriminate against &ldquo;H&rdquo;.&nbsp;This stands for Who, What, Where, When, Why &amp; How. Who was involved? What was your action or what was the desired outcome? Where did the project take place? When did the project occur? Why did the project succeed/fail? How did you or your team achieve the desired outcome?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Focus Now</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Great! You are 80% of the way there. By now, you should be looking forward to being asked what is the last project you led, and what was its outcome! The most important part of your entire answer is going to be the &ldquo;how.&rdquo;&nbsp;This is your opportunity to display all of the qualities from the job description that your interviewer is looking for. How did you achieve your desired outcome - through leadership, teamwork, and determination! That&rsquo;s easy for me to say, but it won&rsquo;t be so easy for you. You need to dig a little deeper and give more information than just a few adjectives. Try to quantify your achievements whenever possible.

See why LinkedIn is a networking dream for introverted job seekers.','<p>Networking might as well be a four-letter word, a curse, or a blasphemy for introverts. Sure, sure, we all know the value of connecting with people to open doors for job opportunities. But the mere suggestion is like fingernails on a chalkboard to us. I&rsquo;d pick staying at home and scrubbing my bathroom floor any day over attending a networking event, thanks very much. Good news! The dreaded cleaning frenzy can wait. We can abandon clever excuses to wiggle out of that horrifying activity of showing up at networking events. We owe massive gratitude to LinkedIn because suddenly, we have access to &gt;460M people, all from the comfort of our homes where we can carefully craft our approaches and wordsmith our interactions. Networking on LinkedIn takes several forms, but three distinct approaches make introverts cheer, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Fully Developed Profile Replaces Nervously Rehearsed Speeches</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of the elevator pitch, right? That snappy introduction that&rsquo;ll make people pay attention and steer you towards your dream job in your target organizations. Kick that elevator pitch aside and turn your attention to your LinkedIn profile. Pay attention to five key areas: &bull; Headline: You&rsquo;ve got 120 characters to define yourself. That&rsquo;s prime real estate, rich with keywords and branding opportunity. Make them count!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>For more, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/linkedin-headline-ideas-that-dont-suck/\">LinkedIn Headline Ideas That Don&rsquo;t Suck.</a></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Summary: Use first person language to simulate a 2,000-character conversation with your target audience. It&rsquo;s a networking interaction without the sweat and agony. Bring your favorite beverage to your keyboard and take your sweet time putting together your highlights. Use your line return liberally so that you have ample white space. This makes it easy to skim your Summary for keywords and marquee accomplishments. &bull; Skills: You&rsquo;ve got 50 slots here to outline your expertise, and you can decide the order that they appear. You&rsquo;ve also got control over whether people endorse you or not. You&rsquo;re the architect of your own profile in so many ways. &bull; Experience: Here&rsquo;s your chance to supplement your resume, so instead of copying and pasting (I know how tempting this sounds! But it&rsquo;s a mistake many job seekers make, so take the time to distinguish yourself), add some depth to what&rsquo;s on your resume. As with your resume, you should still define your accomplishments with metrics. However, if your Summary is written in first person language, carry that forth into your Experience section and imagine that you&rsquo;re having a conversation with a decision-maker, someone who can make your career with one click of the mouse. &bull; Recommendations: These short testimonials are listed in your Experience section (not in your Skills section &ndash; those are Endorsements, which are often confused with Recommendations). They carry a great deal of weight, so invest some energy in asking people to write something for you (offer to draft it for them so that you can pack it with keywords!). Try to get at least 2 for your most recent 2-3 positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Group Membership Dramatically Increases Your Profile Reach</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can join up to 100 groups on LinkedIn. It&rsquo;s such an easy way for you to connect with decision makers in your industry, and it just takes the click of a button to ask to join groups. It&rsquo;s the virtual equivalent of a massive networking event. You can be in conversation with and be seen by influential people; only you get access and interaction without the agony of deciding what to wear, without the awkward conversational pauses, and without the tense internal dialog about how much longer you&rsquo;ll force yourself to stay at an event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>To find groups that&rsquo;ll be a good fit for you, try these tactics:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; View LinkedIn profiles of your competition, people in positions you covet, and people with hiring authority for jobs you&rsquo;re targeting. Scroll to the bottom of their profiles to see which groups they&rsquo;re in. The groups displayed on their profiles are hotlinks. Click on the titles of the groups to view the group page. If, after reading the group description (pay particular attention to the number of people in each group &ndash; more is better!) you want to join the group, click on the &ldquo;Ask to Join&rdquo; button. &bull; In the search bar at the top of the main page, type in keywords associated with your industry, and you&rsquo;ll see groups that are associated with your specialty. Also, search for groups related to your alma mater, your geographic area, and hobbies (there are a surprising number of groups associated with personal interests such as golf). &bull; Look for groups that LinkedIn recommends for you by clicking on Interests on the main menu, selecting Groups, and clicking on the Discover tab.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s Possible To Privately Signal To Recruiters That You&rsquo;re In A Job Search</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>LinkedIn has a new feature that allows job seekers to indicate that they&rsquo;re looking for opportunities. Just go to the Jobs tab on the main page, select the Preferences tab and move the setting that says &ldquo;Let recruiters know you&rsquo;re open&rdquo; to &ldquo;On.&rdquo; Mercifully, LinkedIn has created this tool that allows people to communicate that they&rsquo;re in a search. Now job seekers no longer have to devote precious real estate in their Headlines and Summaries for phrases like &ldquo;Seeking New Opportunities.&rdquo; If you use phrases such as these, you&rsquo;re vulnerable to trolls who will approach you to sell you their services or products. So make sure to use the setting that LinkedIn provides and remove those phrases from your profile. If you&rsquo;re a strong introvert (like me!), you&rsquo;ll quickly find that LinkedIn is a job seeker&rsquo;s playground with many features that allow us to network virtually and bypass the uncomfortable in-person events (or at the very least, supplement them!).

Do you think you know everything about your industry? If so, one well-worded google search will probably be able to change that mindset. Even if you know all the intricacies of an industry, make sure you are up to date on current events as well! Staying up to date will ensure that you will have plenty to discuss with the hiring manager during the interview. Interviews can often lead to small talk about experiences throughout your career. So, having enough to talk about will only benefit you in this scenario.

But seriously, you should be able to give quite a detailed lesson if required. Be sure to study up on not only the current state of an industry but also the history and how it has developed into modern times. To go even further, provide your insight of where the industry is headed in the future. If you do this, stick to 1-3 years in the future as nobody really knows what is going to happen beyond that timeline. Whatever your answer entails, do not make anything up or pretend to be more seasoned than you are. The hiring manager should have extensive knowledge about the industry, so you are probably not fooling anyone. Avoid topics you are fuzzy on or have limited experience with. The interviewer could ask you to expand on any topic you discuss, so you do not want to start stumbling over your words.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You Got This!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is your chance to really get technical and separate yourself from the other candidates. Believe me when I&nbsp;say that many people do not prepare for an interview at all. Preparing just a little bit will put you ahead of those who don&#39;t. Have confidence in your abilities/knowledge and answer directly. As long as you have studied in preparation, you should have no problem expressing your interest, passion, and knowledge of the industry you are applying for.

The trick is to stay &ldquo;truthful&rdquo; as lying to this question can get you into trouble if you end up receiving an offer. You can stretch the truth or avoid the question by using one of the examples above if needed. Also, do not make your answer too personal by mentioning a struggle you or a loved one is going through or something of that nature. You may earn the interviewers sympathy, but this is bound to make the conversation awkward and not help you in the job hunt. Awkward answers usually mean that you will not receive a call back or a job offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Crush It!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you keep the above in mind, you are bound to nail this question as it is one of the most delicate questions a hiring manager can ask.

By then, you will have wished you read this article. Most people dread discussing salary with friends and family&hellip; So much so, that it is considered rude to even bring up the discussion! Unfortunately, this is a fairly common question when an individual is on the job hunt. There are a few ways to effectively answer this question without yelling, &ldquo;None of your business!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It All Starts With The Application</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many applications include &ldquo;Salary History&rdquo; or &ldquo;Desired Salary&rdquo; as one of the required fields. We advise that you do not disclose these figures at this point of your job search. The number you provide could actually hurt your chances of being called in for an interview, regardless of your experience. If possible, use dashes or Asterisks in place of a value in order to fill the required text and move on with the application. The goal here is to make sure you are considered for your qualifications and not rejected because of money. You will most likely be asked again, but establishing a ground in which you can negotiate later will only benefit you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So You Got A Call Back?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have received a call for an interview, Congratulations! Now, many companies are different so whether you have 1 or 5 interviews to go through, try to withhold a dollar figure as long as possible. The company is not asking about your salary history just for fun&hellip; They will use this number to gauge your market value. They will not disclose what they have paid people in a given position in the past, so why should you?! For further preparation, check out our blog of <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers\">50 Top Interview Questions and Answers!</a></strong> When asked this question in an interview, keep in mind that the first person to disclose a figure loses. You should be able to flip the question on them fairly easily by asking for their expectations for the position. If they give you a certain range, you should use that figure as a STARTING POINT when negotiations start. This is because they are not going to throw out their top offer; you have to work for it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You &ldquo;Spilled The Beans&rdquo;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Either you felt pressured or you assume that what you made previously aligns well with the future employers expectations&hellip; That&rsquo;s OK! As long as you are not asked to leave once you have disclosed a figure, it is not the end of the world. Make sure that if you disclose your salary history, you tell the truth! Hiring managers can potentially verify your pay range, so lying would not help your chances in this scenario. Ideally, you have a realistic net worth in mind and the employer is not trying to &ldquo;low-ball&rdquo; you in terms of their offer. Remember to include bonuses and stock options if you choose to share your salary information. This will ensure that you receive a higher starting salary with the new company than if you were to leave these items out of your salary history. Good Luck!

When someone asks, &quot;What are your salary expectations&quot; this is a clear sign you are nearing the finish line. All your hard work of preparing a resume, applying for jobs, and phone screens has paid off. Unless you are already a master negotiator, it is important to take some time to prepare for this question before the interview. In this article, I will show you the best way to answer &quot;What are your salary expectations&quot; without leaving any money on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Salary Checkers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing that you are going to want to do to prepare is figure out what salary range is realistic. You can take advantage of a variety of websites including <a href=\"http://www.payscale.com/\">Payscale.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/\">Glassdoor.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.salary.com/\">Salary.com</a>. If you are lucky, these sites will have the exact salary that you can expect from the company you are applying too. This is typically only the case for larger companies that have a lot of salary data. If you can&#39;t find the exact company or position, you can look up industry averages based on location. <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/10-best-career-sites-to-land-your-dream-job/\"><strong>10 Best Career Sites To Land Your Dream Job</strong></a> Once you have figured out what the average person is making in your position, it&#39;s time to evaluate yourself. Do you deserve a salary that is above average or below average based on your skills? You should be able to come up with two numbers to help you answer what are your salary expectations. 1. What is your dream salary that you couldn&#39;t turn down? 2. What is the absolute lowest salary you could accept before walking away from the offer? Now that you have just determined a salary range that you can work with, it&#39;s time to move on to the actual interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Avoid Answering First</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are sitting face to face with a hiring manager who asks you &quot;What are your salary expectations?&quot; it&#39;s important to be tough! By now, you should have a range in your mind that you are willing to work with. Here are some answers that can help you rebuttal this interview question. &quot;From researching this position on Glassdoor.com I found that 80-95K / year is pretty typical. Is that the same for XYZ Company?&quot; &quot;To be honest, I am much more interested in finding a long term position where I can learn and grow. I am confident that an amazing company such as yours will offer a salary that is competitive in the current market.&quot; A similar answer can be given for the interview question What Is Your Salary History. &quot;Well sir/mam, this position is not exactly the same as my previous job. I would prefer that we discuss what my duties would be here and then determine a fair salary for this job.&quot; Salary negotiation is like a game of chess. Each person takes a turn making a move and eventually one player runs out of moves. Your goal is to &quot;pass the rock&quot; back to the interviewer each time they ask what is your salary history.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Provide A Range</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many times, you are going to have a lot of success just using the two steps listed above. However, as good of a negotiator you become, there is always a hiring manager that is a little bit better. This means, there are occasions that you will need to provide a range first. You should have already determined a range that you are willing to accept before the interview. Everybody knows that this question is going to come with a little bit of negotiation. When giving your salary expectations, avoid stating a single number. Don&#39;t say, &quot;I would like to make 80,000 per year.&quot; If that is the truth, then at least say &quot;I would like to make 80,000 - 95,000 per year.&quot; This way you are still within a realistic range of your 80,000 but you might even get offered an additional 15,000 you would never have had if you didn&#39;t provide a range! How do you determine what kind of a range you should provide? First, if you haven&#39;t already, answer these two questions. 1. What is your dream salary that you couldn&#39;t turn down? Answer: 95,000 per year 2. What is the absolute lowest salary you could accept before walking away from the offer? Answer: 80,000 per year So your range is 80,000 - 95,000 per year. Be honest with the hiring manager. Being transparent with your salary expectations will get you a long way! Let them know that your range is 80,000 - 95,000, but 80,000 is the bare minimum. They should be fully aware that 80,000 is a number that you would have to consider and the opportunity would have to be perfect. If you are an excellent candidate, you will have no problem finding your dream salary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get Paid What You Deserve</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t settle for the company that wants to find the cheapest new hire.

Be prepared to describe a time you demonstrated leadership.','<p>A common misconception made by job seekers is that leadership questions will only be asked for management positions. This has been disproved time and time again. No matter what level in the company you are interviewing for, it is highly recommended to prepare at least one example that demonstrates your leadership ability. Best-case scenario, your preparation paid off when you are put on the spot and asked to describe a time you demonstrated leadership. Worst-case scenario, you are not asked this particular question, but you have an impressive example to use in another question that just so happens also to demonstrate leadership. Win-win!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Is Leadership?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The term leadership can mean different things to different people. Merriam-Webster defines leadership as the power or ability to be in charge or command of other people. Your interviewer is going to expect you to demonstrate a higher level of leadership than Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s definition. This higher level goes beyond the act of just managing individuals or projects. Leaders possess skills at the root of who they are as a person. They don&rsquo;t just take the initiative, but they spread their ideas and passions like wildfires to everyone else. A leader is not the same as a dictator. A leader builds a network of followers whatever the size and can empower, uplift, and develop them. When applying this idea of leadership to the interview process, it becomes pretty clear what the hiring manager wants to hear. They don&rsquo;t just want someone who can tell others what to do. But someone who possesses the skills listed above that is needed to run a team, department, or organization. No matter what position you are applying for, you can guarantee leadership skills will be desired. Whether you are applying for an entry or senior-level position, you can&rsquo;t go wrong by showing the hiring manager that you have what it takes to move up the ranks into leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Start By Planning Your Answer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you know what the hiring manager wants to hear, it&rsquo;s time that you figured out an answer to their question. When being asked to describe a time you demonstrated leadership you are going to want to focus on a somewhat recent example. Mentioning something that happened ten years ago is not going to carry much weight in present day. This would raise the question, &ldquo;Has he/she not demonstrated leadership in 10 years that they would have to give an example so far back?&rdquo; Any question that is asking you to recap your past and provide an example should be answered using the S.T.A.R. approach. If you are unfamiliar with the STAR format, then take 60 seconds to look at #8 on the article <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-answer-the-16-most-common-interview-questions/\">How To Answer The 16 Most Common Interview Questions.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Example Answer &ndash; Describe A Time You Demonstrated Leadership</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Pamela Skillings provides a great example answer in her article <strong><a href=\"https://biginterview.com/blog/2014/01/leadership-interview-questions.html\">Answering Behavioral Interview Questions: Leadership</a></strong>. Below is everything you could need to know from this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>S/T (Situation/Task)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; When I was at ABC Company, we went through some company-wide layoffs. &bull; The team of five that remained in the department had to absorb the duties of the two that left. &bull; As a result, people were overworked and morale suffered. &bull; At the same time, more mistakes were being made because attention was so scattered. &bull; As the manager, it was my job to get performance back on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>A (Approach/Action)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; I scheduled a meeting with the full team to discuss strategies. &bull; Communicated my appreciation for all of their hard work during a challenging time for the company. &bull; I asked for their assistance in identifying ways for us all to be more efficient &ndash;including me! &bull; I made it clear that this was a brainstorming meeting to come up with options &mdash; that no idea was stupid and that it was a safe environment for making suggestions. &bull; We spent an hour capturing ideas on a whiteboard, then voted on the five with the most potential. I then assigned each person to do more research on how we might implement one of the ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>R (Results)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; First of all, the team responded very positively to this approach. They loved the idea of being empowered to help find a solution. Instead of complaining, they channeled their energy in a more productive way once they knew that they would be heard. &bull; Right off the bat, we came up with two ideas that could be implemented quickly and save us a lot of time. &bull; One idea was to eliminate a weekly report. This freed up 8 hours each week &mdash; including two hours of my time and three hours for my top account manager. &bull; Another was to train Penny, our administrative assistant, to take on some of the tasks that were burdening our account managers. &bull; We also decided to incorporate brainstorming and idea evaluation into our staff meetings each month. &bull; We are now more efficient and morale is way up. &bull; My boss even asked me to help him roll this process out to the other departments in our division.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Finishing Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that your answer is going to be unique from anyone else&rsquo;s. At least it should be! Don&rsquo;t give a generic answer about a team or project that you lead. Be as detailed as you can. If possible, go one step further and take a look at the job description. Try to find any obvious leadership skills that the company might desire and customize your answer according to the job description.

Just because... does not mean they are always going to have the best answer','<p>Have you ever been in an awkward situation with a manager where they ask you to do something, but you know it&rsquo;s not right? This happens all the time! Just because your manager is your superior does not mean that they are always going to have the best answers. In this article, you will learn what to do if a manager asks you to do something that you disagree with. It&rsquo;s great to trust your manager and listen to what they say, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you follow them blindly. In fact, a good manager will thrive on the support that the team offers when constructively challenging their decisions. This question is not designed to see whether you would do immoral or illegal activities for your manager. The intention is to judge your ability to react to a conflicting situation. Whatever this manager is asking you to do, it is important that you express your concerns in a non-threatening way, and try to offer a solution that would make both parties happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How You Should Answer &ndash; Example</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It depends entirely on what you are asking me&nbsp;to do. If you told me to do something that contradicts my moral beliefs, I would try my best to explain my feelings to you and then find a solution we both agree with. If I just disagreed with the way my manager was doing something, I would politely recommend an alternative way and explain its advantages. Regardless of the situation, I would take a closer look at what is being asked and figure out a solution to achieve the same results without contradicting my moral beliefs.&rdquo; For everything you could ever need to know about interviewing, check out the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers\">50 Top Job Interview Questions And Answers</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Focus Points</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice that this person never told their manager NO (at least not yet). There is a much better way to go about this then just defying your boss. Make sure to propose a better solution if there is any. If you have laid out a better solution and your manager is still asking you to do things a certain way, then you should trust your superior and follow his or her instructions. At that point, they will be the ones held responsible if anything goes wrong. However, if you are still being asked to do something immoral or illegal after you have explained that you are uncomfortable performing this act, it is time to take your concerns to HR. If your manager is out of line, it&rsquo;s probably best that he/she gets reported anyway. You will be doing yourself and your future coworkers a favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S.

Helping the hiring manager envision you in the position with actual research and realistic goals will heighten your chances of receiving an offer, exponentially! Some of you may think this is a 20-page thesis paper. However, the more focused and to the point your plan is, the better. Try and stick to a short PowerPoint presentation or a 1-3 page written document. To find out how to create a 30-60-90 day plan, see our article <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-create-a-30-60-90-day-plan-for-an-interview/\">How To Create A 30-60-90 Day Plan For An Interview.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Focus On The Question</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Assuming you have created your plan and an attractive means of presenting the plan, you must focus on what the hiring manager wants to hear. It is essential that you only discuss actions and outcomes that you can control. Don&rsquo;t get caught up in imaginary targets that are irrelevant because you do not know the inner workings of the company. Ideally, this question would be asked in a second interview because of limited sources of information for most companies. In the first interview, you will be able to ask questions and get a more realistic outlook of the company culture and what they will expect of you. If you are applying for a position that only requires one interview, your margin for error will decrease. This plan will then focus on what you can do as a new hire and the hoops you are willing to jump through to be successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who This Question Is Geared For</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This question is typically asked of candidates who have a lot of freedom to make decisions on their own. This includes manager&#39;s and executives as most entry level jobs have a moderately defined job description with little wiggle room. Just because you may be applying for an entry level job does not mean you cannot build and present a plan. In this case, you would describe how you will best utilize your training and build relationships with your coworkers. If you are a manager or higher, you will have built this plan based on your industry experience and your expectations for your given industry. You will be able to go into detail of how you intend to interact with your new employees while gaining their trust and respect. This is essential for any managers&rsquo; success as you are only as good as the production of your team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Breakdown Of Your Plan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some resources suggest a flat 90-day plan. Although this is fine, breaking up your plan in 30-day increments displays a step-by-step plan with each tier building upon the other. The below outline will describe what your plan should focus on for each period: First 30 days &ndash; Focus on training, finding mentors, and embracing the company culture as it relates to both your job description and the people around you. 30-60 days &ndash; Implementing your training and experience into action while working with your supervisor to optimize your performance 60-90 days &ndash; Add your personal touch to the position. Be an effective leader/coworker and build relationships that benefit your position and the company as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s Showtime</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, there is some room to play with your plan as the position calls for it. But do not step out of what you know. The hiring manager will know what a realistic approach to the position is. So, you will not be able to &ldquo;Fake it till you make it&rdquo; so to speak. The fact that you have this plan in place will speak volumes to your work ethic and make a great impression with the interviewer. Remember, as long as you do your homework and prepare to present your plan, you&#39;ll separate yourself from other candidates. Prepare to take constructive criticism and make sure you can back up what you plan to do. Good Luck!

Here are 3 Investments To Improve Your Chances Of Landing A Job In 2017','<p>As a job seeker, you are accustomed to expecting a return on your job search in the form of a steady pay check and gainful employment, right? While a steady pay check is the goal, you might need to make an investment at times to get to that point. Job seekers that move quickly through the process of landing a job understand that they must give a little on the front end at times. Getting a new &ldquo;interview outfit&rdquo;, professionally crafted resume and other obvious expenses are still relevant. Below are a few additional investments to consider if you are currently seeking employment or will be in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Volunteer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The skills needed to remain successful in your industry will change at a rapid pace. If you spend just a few months unemployed, you may end up behind. When you&#39;re out of the loop of new technology, the impact of being out of work is intensified. Volunteering in your industry can keep your skills from becoming stagnant. Is there a nonprofit organization, school or small business in the area with a lean staff? This is a perfect place offer your expertise. It is a win-win situation. The company will receive the assistance and you will have recent experience on your resume, you will be staying busy and keeping your skills sharp. The added bonuses of volunteering include working alongside professionals that can help you to get hired or refer you to someone else with a job opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Professional Headshots</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This price of headshots may vary but do not have to be overly expensive. You may be able to find photography student in your area that will take your photos for a small investment or a grade for a class. Investing in professional headshots will improve your personal and professional brand. A professional photo will also make you more approachable on social media (including LinkedIn.)

The fees can range in price but it is worth the investment. Joining will provide excellent resources for networking and will give your resume a boost. Another benefit of joining an association is the ability to network with your peers and hiring professionals in your industry. Most associations also have a job board that may list jobs exclusively for the members. In that case, you will be able to get a leg up on the competition and non-members. Being a proactive job seeker is necessary to stand out above the competition.Whether your investment includes time or money, the return on the investment will be well worth it.

Here are 7 easy and essential interviewing tips for job seekers...','<p>After ten years of recruiting on the agency side, I would like to start with some basic interviewing and resume tips. Often a recruiter might counsel or recommend these tips to their candidates, but with the pace of things today these basics can get overlooked.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1) Keep your resume up to date.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I suggest showing your resume to a few people for feedback to make sure it truly highlights your strengths. Please do not be afraid to toot your horn on your resume. One it shows confidence and two it lets you stand out among the other candidates. Also, in my opinion, chronological resumes are the way to go. The functional resumes are considered not acceptable to many hiring managers. As I have seen these resumes be declined over and over again. Managers feel someone is trying to hide something by using a functional resume. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-to-include-in-a-resume-16-best-things/\">What To Include In A Resume - 16 Best Things</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2) Please bring several copies of your resume to the interview.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I still have managers tell me the candidate did not bring a copy of their resume with them. Please think about your audience, and while this may not apply in every situation, I think it is best to be conservative here and bring a few copies. It is also nice to have one for you to look at so when they ask questions and are referring to your resume you can glance down and be prompted by the details in front of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3) Arrive 10-15 minutes early.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving early will give you a moment to breath and reflect before an interview as well as not feel rushed. Please do not arrive 30 minutes before an interview. If you do, I would recommend sitting in your car for a few minutes. The last thing you would want to do is stress out your interviewer for arriving too early.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4) Research the company before an interview.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is ideal to learn about the company where you will be interviewing. As a recruiter, I constantly have hiring managers tell about candidates that do not even know what the company they are interviewing at does. Try to do a little homework beforehand and it will pay off big time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5) Be prepared with a couple of questions to ask.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a few questions after the interview will help confirm your interest in the position. If you need additional help with preparing questions for your interview, check out the article, <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/do-you-have-any-questions-for-me/\">Do You Have Any Questions For Me?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6) Thank the interviewers for their time.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure to thank the interviewer and state that you are interested and excited for the job. I frequently hear situations where the manager is unsure whether the candidate even wants the job after an interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7) Lastly, treat everyone you meet even the receptionist with respect.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s always important to treat everybody with respect, but when it comes to interviews, you better bring your A game. You never know what sort of influence any given person could have.</p>','Jennifer-Leck.jpg','2017-01-03 18:40:00','7-easy-and-essential-interviewing-tips-for-job-seekers','7 Easy & Essential Interviewing Tips For Job Seekers','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(68,1,'How to Create A Strong LinkedIn Profile','Since we live in a social network society, it\'s important that your LinkedIn profile represents you in the best way... create a strong Linkedin profile','<p>LinkedIn is a social platform for professionals to connect and network. Since we live in a social network society, it is important to make sure your LinkedIn profile represents you in the best way possible. It is an elevator speech/resume/social network profile wrapped into one. You can reach potential bosses, colleagues, collaborate and showcase your work from this space. To start, think about whom your audience is and how you want to present yourself. Your profile is a first impression and a reference point. Are there profiles that you have admired and thought: &ldquo;I need to meet this person&rdquo;? What did you like about that profile? Take note of what you like from these profiles and try to incorporate some of those elements. Then, if you want to create a strong profile, there are seven major sections to consider. With some attention to each of them, you can ensure your professional story is told in an engaging style to draw people in visually. Here are some tips on each of these sections to help maximize the space and create a profile that helps you showcase your talent and shine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1) Photo</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the place where you make your first impression.

Play around with titles and find one that best suits you. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/linkedin-headline-ideas-that-dont-suck/\">LinkedIn Headline Ideas That Don&rsquo;t Suck</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3) Summary</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can shine brightly here and show your audience what you are made of. Keep it short and to the point, but grab their attention. No one wants to read a boring objective. Instead, let others know who you are, what you&rsquo;re capable of and how you have made a difference in the professional world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4) Work Experience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Work experience should read like your resume. Avoid long paragraphs and run-on sentences. Bullets are great and help move the reader&rsquo;s eyes down the page. Use action words and omit &ldquo;responsible for&rdquo;. Recruiters and potential manager want to know what you did and how you did it. If you can quantify results, add those numbers</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5) Recommendations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Recommendations are important to your profile. They are like having references available and helps people know what it is like to work with you and what to expect. If your profile is lacking recommendations, ask for them and write a few for others as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6) Endorsements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Endorsements are also a great way to quickly show your areas of strength. Place them in order of importance (which is an easy edit). You can have as many as you would like, but make sure the most important ones are at the top of the list. You can also ask for endorsements and give a few out as well to reciprocate the favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7) Connections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Connections are important in networking. Add connections by sending a quick note to grow your network. Connections are also important when trying to connect with a potential employer. If you are well connected, you can easily ask for an introduction to start a networking conversation with ease. Following these tips will create a strong profile that tells your professional story. Once completed, networking on this platform will become much easier. There are so many great resources, companies and potential connections on LinkedIn. A strong profile will help move you forward in reaching your career goals.</p>','Emily-Silva.jpg','2017-01-03 18:53:11','how-to-create-a-strong-linkedin-profile','How To Create A Strong LinkedIn Profile | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(69,1,'How To Target And Customize Your Resume','A resume is a driving force for your job search and a career marketing document... learn how to target and customize your resume to get the job of your...','<p>A resume is a driving force for your job search and a career marketing document to gain an interview. Thus, your resume is 50% of the hiring process. So, let&rsquo;s be sure to apply a solid routine in targeting your resume for each job you apply for. This will increase your chances of landing an interview. Of course, everyone at some point is guilty of a simple copy and paste or a &quot;click to submit&quot; without making any changes to target the employer&rsquo;s needs. I know this off hand becauseI have about 35% of clients&rsquo; who admit to it. So, after today, you will need to be more efficient and effective in targeting your job. Spending only an hour longer can make a huge difference in scoring low or high on Applicant Tracking Systems(ATS). Remember, it will always be worth it to put in the effort during your job search. Be consistent and invest time in yourself to produce results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Content Is Key</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To meet the employers&rsquo; needs, you must communicate your value while successfully targeting your resume. However, content is vital too when aiming to target your resume for employment. For that reason, surround the resume with great content that will convey your value in the workplace to recruiters&rsquo;, employers&#39; and other decision makers. Keep the company in mind while customizing the resume. This will keep you on track and focused on creating a&nbsp;resume for their eyes only. This helps the employer to notice that you took your time in targeting the resume to catch their attention. It also shows that you are ambitious for the position. So, the goal is to target your resume for that one particular job. Your resume should clearly represent what you have to offer to the company and their culture. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs/\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For Jobs</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Review The Job Description</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get you prepared to target your resume by reviewing the position you are interested in in-depth. First, be sure you qualify for the position at least 60% by evaluating the entire posting from top to bottom. Second, you may want to print the job posting you desire along with two similar postings. Highlight each section&#39;s requirements to review and match your current resume against the posting. Simultaneously, find the most commonly repeated words and phrases to add in your resume (only if you have these skills). Third, it is time to put the pen and paper to work. Tailor your resume to the job title, job description, job duties, experience, education, skills, and qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Start With The Summary</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective here is to customize your summary to make you appear as the best fit for the position. Most importantly, use keywords and phrases to reflect the entire job posting while adding action verbs for the human eye along with accomplishment statements that reinforce your value and their needs. Fourth, be sure to use commonly used headings to include a summary, skills, professional experience, education, training, and affiliations, or the titles in the posting. In turn, this will boost your probability by 30% in passing the ATS. Become a final candidate by targeting the resume in as many areas as possible. Lastly, it is essential to use outstanding content, action verbs, numbers, and the keywords from the posting. Speak the industry language in developing a successfully targeted resume for the job. Add keywords throughout the entire resume with phrases which mirror your expertise for the job. Please, don&rsquo;t forget to proofread for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors! <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-great-resume-summary-statement/\">How to Write A Great Resume Summary Statement</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making It Through ATS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Targeting your resume to meet the employer needs is key and can be done quickly by applying branding resume techniques. Still, your resume must rise in the keyword search to at least an 89% through the ATS for an interview. Facts, only 2% - 3% of candidates&rsquo; are selected when applying for openings where 115-240 applicants have applied. Remember, the targeted resume is 50% of the battle. You still have 50% left to capture the employer&#39;s attention. Hence, 100% of referred candidates who have the qualifications will get an interview, according to one of most reliable sources, Gerry Crisp. Overall, you get results from a targeted resume. But you get better results by seeking referrals to hiring managers at your targeted companies. So, use networking as a core component and an advanced job search method that produces the most leads, interviews, and job offers to be able to say, &quot;I Got the Job.&quot;</p>','Latoya-Raymond.jpg','2017-01-03 19:36:41','how-to-target-and-customize-your-resume','How To Target And Customize Your Resume | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(70,1,'Job Searching: A Manageable Affliction','As a person who has struggled in a job search like anyone else, I have always believed the best advice is no advice. Job searching will work different for..','<p>As a Talent Scout and a Recruiter, I am often asked to offer tips for job seekers. As a person who has struggled in a job search like anyone else, I have always believed the best advice is no advice. What works for me may not work for you. At the end of the day, YOU are going to do what YOU are going to do; which is exactly how it should be. I&#39;m going to share with you a personal story, and I do hope that you can pick out some ideas that work for you to make your job search successful and help you create a manageable and realistic plan. Once upon a time, a poor unsuspecting grocery store clerk asked an exhausted woman &quot;would you like to donate a dollar to Childhood Diabetes?&rdquo; She looked the cashier dead in the eye and said &ldquo;Diabetes has taken enough from us. It isn&rsquo;t going to get one more dollar of mine.&rdquo; The woman&#39;s child had been diagnosed recently, and she was at her wit&#39;s end trying to manage it. It has been five years since my daughter was diagnosed. She was ten at the time, and she had lived ten years (her entire life) as a regular kid. I would love to tell you that we mastered this affliction and put it in check. I&#39;d like to say you that all the wishing, magical thinking, and (terrible) suggestions from those who meant well made her condition disappear.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>That isn&rsquo;t what happened.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For five years, Diabetes was a struggle between me vs. her, us vs. doctors, doctors vs. her school, and so on. We endured frequent hospital stays. I had to wrestle sugary treats out of her grip. She had to accept a new lifestyle.All this time her blood sugars bounced between high &amp; low. One day, after yet another hospitalization, we found a new specialist. She was a young, new doctor. She looked at my daughter and said something no one had ever said before: &ldquo;I want to do what works for you.&rdquo; Wow. Who knew that was possible? We could make this thing work for us?&rdquo; She went on to ask my daughter (now a teenager) about her REAL lifestyle. &ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to guess you eat the way I did when I was 15. You skip breakfast, pick at your lunch, come home and eat nonstop in between all your activities until bed.&rdquo; My daughter nodded sheepishly. &ldquo;So let&rsquo;s make it work for you. I don&rsquo;t want to keep forcing you on some meal plan that you will never follow. It is only going to set you up for failure. Let&rsquo;s do something that works for you.&rdquo; They worked together to develop a realistic plan that reached for attainable results. By adjusting it to HER life, she is better able to accept it as a PART of her life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>How does this relate to your job search?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I also want to do what works for you. That means helping you create a realistic, manageable plan that works for YOU. Let&#39;s start with five key factors in managing your job search:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ACCEPTANCE:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Be realistic. Decide on 3-5 &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; and 3-5 &ldquo;refuse to haves.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;ve just been fired or are miserable at work, congratulations! You now HAVE to do something. The quicker you get to work, the better. Keep your options open. Spend time looking for the next step daily. Don&rsquo;t just take any job. It&rsquo;s difficult to commit to your needs when your savings start to dwindle but staying in a position because you HAVE to stay isn&rsquo;t good for anyone. Have self-discipline. Set goals. Be accountable. Have an outcome in mind. Don&rsquo;t dismiss opportunities that don&rsquo;t match your mental picture. Consider every opportunity that presents itself. If it isn&rsquo;t what you want, let them know you&rsquo;re considering all possibilities. That way, you have the option to revisit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been unemployed for a while, focus on putting <em>something </em>on your resume.&nbsp; Be judicious. If you were laid off from your executive position and had to take a cleaning job, be proud. If you took a sabbatical to try raising sheep, that&rsquo;s wonderful. But, keep those jobs off your resume. People are naturally skeptical and critical. Arguing that they prove your diversity of skills isn&rsquo;t going to help. In the same token, if you are applying for a cleaning job or herding sheep, don&rsquo;t add an executive position. The reader will assume you don&rsquo;t want the job, but HAVE to take it. Keep your positions aligned with your desired career. If you have blank space, fill it with independent consulting. The busier you make yourself, the more time you&rsquo;ll make for these activities. Most importantly, your job search will become manageable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FIND THE MIDDLE GROUND:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Decide on the top 5 things you want from a career. Take an hour every week (or day if you can) to think about who you are and what you want. Don&#39;t pigeon hole yourself or measure your activities by unrealistic standards. You aren&#39;t going to become Shakespeare overnight. You are going to need &quot;fun time&quot; to unwind every day. Telling my daughter she had to follow a strict schedule was never going to work for her and neither is committing all your time to a job search going to work for you. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/best-tips-for-a-mid-career-change/\">Best Tips For A Mid-Career Change</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>KNOW YOUR LIMITS:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The mistake most &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; enthusiasts make is filling your head with magical thinking. They&rsquo;ll tell you to repeat daily &ldquo;I am a Pulitzer Prize winning writer.&rdquo; They will tell you to focus on this one goal.How realistic is this when you spend 8 hours a day in a different field? We all have limits. We just need to be realistic about what can happen right now. Start earning credentials. Write an article. Start a blog. Focus on the activities first, and the success will come. Be sure your activities are realistic, accomplishable, and broken down into weeks and days. Create realistically attainable goals and break them down into years, months, and weeks (no less). We don&#39;t shoot for low blood sugar. We shoot for counting all carbs and writing down our numbers daily. Focus on the activities, and the results follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ACCOUNTABILITY:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Goals and activities will get you nowhere if they are just magical numbers. Write them down. Post them where you can see them in your home and office. Do what works for YOU. Reward yourself based on ACTIVITIES. If you commit to contacting five people this week at places you want to work and you actually do it, reward yourself with an extra hour of leisure time or a treat from your favorite coffee shop. Sleep in a couple of hours extra this Sunday. Be realistic. Don&rsquo;t reward yourself with anything you will regret (such as something out of your budget). Know your limits and don&#39;t commit to anything you can&#39;t reasonably do each day. We don&#39;t reward a good diet with cake. But we do know we still need cake now and then. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-entry-level-jobs/\">How To Apply For Entry-Level Jobs</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FLEXIBILITY:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t chain yourself to one idea or one plan. Everyone thinks that you work hard and eventually you &ldquo;make it.&rdquo; The truth is that you will work hard, and you will make it, then fail, then start again, make it again, and fail again over and over. You must do this until&nbsp;you build up enough credentials and have enough going to keep you floating when you aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;making it.&rdquo; The big break isn&rsquo;t a guarantee. That&#39;s why you must reward your activities. When the recruiter calls, and it isn&rsquo;t the ideal salary or title, be flexible. Think about those 3-5 &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; and those 3-5 &ldquo;refuse to deal withs.&rdquo; Does it have a few of the &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; or &ldquo;refuse to deal withs?&rdquo; Does it have the potential to get you the &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; in the next year or two? If the client passes on you, there will be another opportunity. Don&rsquo;t call the recruiter or the client, repeatedly arguing the outcome. This is YOUR job search. You can&#39;t rely on someone else to manage it. When things don&#39;t turn out, try something different and keep moving forward. I am from that world where they tell you that you are LUCKY to have ANY job. That isn&rsquo;t a mentality to base any career around. No one owns your path but you. If you only take one thing from this, I want it to be to <strong>stay realistic</strong>. The best anyone can ask of you is that you be you. Set goals you can achieve and when you reach them, reward yourself. Be consistent, and your search will become manageable. The results you seek will soon follow.</p>','Marick-Kalchert.jpg','2017-01-03 21:01:58','job-searching-a-manageable-affliction','Job Searching: A Manageable Affliction - Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(71,1,'New Year, New Plan To Land The Dream Job','Whatever your new goals are, they cannot be achieved without a plan. 2017 is a new year, with a new plan to land the dream job you have been waiting for.','<p>With the New Year in full swing, many of us reflect on the past year and have a new and refreshed ambition to take on new challenges in 2017. Whether your goal is to eat healthier, save money, spend more time with family&hellip;whatever your new goals are, they cannot be achieved without a plan. Today, I am happy to reveal some steps you can take to put you one step closer to landing that highly coveted job. As an agency recruiter at a top IT staffing agency, I hope to be able to share some knowledge and insight into how you can sharpen your job hunt and interview skills! Read on for a list of some of my quick tips.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. First Impressions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you apply for a job, your first impression to a recruiter comes in the form of a resume. Ultimately, a resume should showcase your key accomplishments and the duties of your experiences. Make sure they relate to the job that you are applying for. Resumes should be succinct! Long essays should not have a place in your resume. If we want to know more, we want to hear about it in the interview. There should be no more than a maximum of five to six bullet points per section. The overall look of your resume should be clean and easy to read at a glance. Recruiters often spend less than a minute per resume since they have many other resumes to screen. Keep a space between each resume section. Try bolding or capitalizing these titles to visually separate different sections. You can definitely get creative with different borders, layouts, and border colors depending on your industry. But remember, keep it simple and organized. I would suggest adding color to the borders only and to stick with just one color. Using up to two different shades of the same color can also be an option. Make sure to keep the colors a neutral, darker shade that is easily readable and appealing to most people.

What&rsquo;s Your Number?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the recruiter wants to hear more about you after seeing your resume. It is often surprising to me how casual some people take initial phone screens. This phone screen should almost be thought of as the talk with your date&rsquo;s parents before the date. If you do not get past his/her parents, then you do not get a date with&hellip;the Hiring Manager! This means that your conduct over the phone, the way you answer the questions, and how you sell yourself will determine whether or not you can interview with the Manager. Essentially, how you interview with a Manager should be the same way you interview with a Recruiter. When a recruiter asks you to introduce yourself and elaborate on your experience, they&#39;re looking for a few key things. What is your motivation for this position? Are you passionate? What did you last do or learn in your experiences that can be translatable to this one? Your goal is to paint us a story of who you are and what impact you can have for this position. Note, do not rush when you are speaking. You probably have said the same thing over and over again in the past. But to the Recruiter, this is his/her first time hearing it all. Also, if we ask you if you know a certain technology or have done a certain type of project, elaborate on specific examples in detail (without going on a tangent). This is your chance to tell us what we do not know from your resume!

Culture Fit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to ask the Recruiter what is the best attire to wear before meeting the team and the Manager. Culture fit is huge nowadays, so you definitely do not want to look as if you do not blend in before you even get the job. If the attire is casual at the company, opt for business casual to show that you are still serious about the interview but still aware of the company&rsquo;s culture. For more on dress attire,&nbsp;check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/preparing-for-a-job-interview-what-to-bring-what-to-wear-and-more\">Preparing For A Job Interview &ndash; What To Bring, What To Wear, &amp; More.</a></strong> Obviously, prepare for what was told to you such as a coding test, whiteboarding test, and so on. Having prepared for the technical portion, be sure to knock it out of the park in terms of connecting with the Manager and the team. Be professional and cordial but also conversational! If you can show them your interest with thoughtful questions about them, the company, or even if you can have a normal conversation on the way from the elevator to the meeting room, it will make you more memorable and seem like someone who is a pleasure to potentially work with. When you talk about your background, be sure to emphasize how your experiences will allow you to make a positive impact on the position you are interviewing for. Lastly, send a thank you email to everyone that you interviewed with. Acknowledge parts of conversations, stumbles in your interview even, and thank them for their time&hellip;this is your last chance to make a final good impression. When it is all said and done, what matters most is that you prepare and give it your best shot. The job market is tough and the competition keeps getting tougher, so I hope that some of these tips will give you that extra confidence and edge. Some of these tips may seem obvious now, but in the moment it can be easy to forget about these simple details that separates the candidate that gets the job from the candidate that does not.

Find a career that makes you happy or be your own boss!','<p>It&rsquo;s time again to ring in a new year by celebrating with family and family, reflecting on the prior year. Our career is often a critical focus area deserving of our attention. Maybe 2017 is the year to ask yourself some thought-provoking questions: Is my job invigorating or is it sapping my energy? Do I create my own schedule and have the flexibility to attend important events with my kids and spouse? Or does someone control my destiny? If I stay where I am today, will I be able to build enough wealth to retire comfortably and be financially secure through retirement? If you&#39;re unable to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the above questions, it may be time to consider becoming your own boss. However, sometimes when we think of change, the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; gets in the way of achieving our life goals. <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/best-tips-for-a-mid-career-change/\"><strong>Best Tips For A Mid-Career Change</strong></a> Could fear be standing in your way? According to dictionary.com, fear is defined as &ldquo;a distressing emotion aroused by impending danger evil, pain, etc. whether the threat is real or imagined;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>When considering business ownership, it&rsquo;s common to feel fear:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fear of failure &bull; Fear of success &bull; Fear of change &bull; Fear of the unknown And the list goes on&hellip; Fear has often been referred to as an acronym, F.E.A.R., which stands for <strong>F</strong>alse <strong>E</strong>vidence <strong>A</strong>ppearing <strong>R</strong>eal. So, if we are not in impending physical danger or pain, then we are creating an illusion of fear in our heads, preventing us from pursuing our dreams. <strong>How do we manage fear?</strong> It&rsquo;s important to let go of our past failures, so they don&rsquo;t define our future. In fact, many people believe that one must fail several times before experiencing success. We can take a lesson from Michael Jordan, one of the greatest NBA basketball players of all times who said:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>&ldquo;I&#39;ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>― Michael Jordan</strong></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We as humans can control our thoughts by becoming more aware of how we process our experiences. It&rsquo;s a method that will require awareness, positive self-talk, razor-sharp focus and consistent practice. By concentrating on these new behaviors, we can overcome our fears, step out of the comfort zone and live our best life!</p>','Crush-FEAR-in-2017-be-your-own-boss.jpg','2017-01-08 01:06:05','crush-fear-in-2017-be-your-own-boss','Crush Fear in 2017 - Be Your Own Boss | Find My Profession','crush fear in 2017 - Be your own boss','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(73,1,'Why Should We Hire You Over Other Candidates?','Why should we hire you over other candidates?

However, being a good fit alone won&rsquo;t cut it. There are a lot of good fits so they need to determine how you rank up against the other candidates. Often times, the hiring manager not only wants to make their own decision, but they want to hear your opinion on this matter. It might sound something like this&hellip; &ldquo;Why should we hire you over other candidates?&rdquo; Out of all the interview questions that you might be asked, this one is arguably the most important. Why should we hire you is not an easy question by any means. The problem with this is that 99% of the time, you have no idea who the other candidates are! How are you to compare yourself with people you don&rsquo;t know?! This question is about you and your ability to confidently explain why you are a good fit for the position. With a little preparation (and your best &ldquo;pump up jam&rdquo;), you should be able to kill this question! <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/preparing-for-a-job-interview-what-to-bring-what-to-wear-and-more\">Preparing For A Job Interview &ndash; What To Bring, What To Wear, &amp; More</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Short And Sweet</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I am sure you have a long list explaining why you are a superior candidate who will outshine the competition&hellip; But it is much more effective to pick a few points and elaborate on each. This will ensure that you leave lasting impression and the hiring manager will not feel overwhelmed and forget all of your good points. By making a list of your best qualities and achievements, you should be able to narrow the list down easily. Quantifying your accomplishments when possible goes a long way towards making a great argument for you as a candidate. Just remember that confidence is key here. No matter what you decide to say in the interview, say it with the utmost confidence. You don&rsquo;t need to know about your competition to be confident that you are the best. Own it, and that will take you a long way! Build up your confidence by practicing the interview question What Are Your Strengths!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be Specific For Each Company You Are Interviewing With</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very important that you create a specific pitch for each company that you are applying for. If you don&rsquo;t, believe us when we say that the other candidates will, which might cause you to be passed up. Using the job requirements/qualifications section of the job post you applied for is a very easy and effective way to get ahead. This will help you narrow your chosen bullet points to elaborate on. Think of any experiences you may have that may be useful to the company that goes beyond the job qualifications. Describing the future you see with the company and how your skill set will help you advance can be very helpful. That does not mean you say something like, &ldquo;Once hired, I&rsquo;m heading straight to the top!&rdquo;&hellip; If you are strategic with your approach, you will be able to present a well-worded pitch that is both memorable and informative.

Stick to what you know and the strong points of your experience. You are here to prepare and you are on the right track! Although preparation is very important, you do not want to answer this question like you are reading it. Memorize the focal points and elaborate effectively while delivering your response with confidence.

Have you gone through the early stages of the interview process? If so, let us help you create a 30-60-90 Day plan for your next (hopefully final) interview! There are many pitfalls to this strategy, but if you know what to avoid, you will position yourself above the rest. Sadly, most people have the tools available&nbsp;but fail to prepare properly for an interview. Do your research and more importantly, be realistic!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Focus On The Company</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is extremely important NOT to create a&ldquo;one plan fits all&rdquo; strategy. Your plan should be used to set you apart from the other candidate. If you show a lack of effort here, you will not leave a lasting impression. Focus on the company&rsquo;s specific needs based on any information you can gather. Hopefully, if you are at this point, you have had previous interviews with a certain company. The culture and perception you have of that company should be a resource to create your plan. You are interviewing to fill a need. Use the mindset that you have already received an offer and now it is time to deliver! Using the job description from the original posting can be a huge help to make sure your plan is relevant.

Breaking your plan up into30-day increments shows a step based plan with each tier building upon the other. Consider using the below template to help outline your plan: <strong>First 30 days</strong> &ndash; Focus on training, finding mentors, and embracing the company culture as it relates to both your job description and the people around you. <strong>30-60 days</strong> &ndash; Implementing your training and experience into action while working with your supervisor to optimize your performance. <strong>60-90 days</strong> &ndash; Adding your personal touch to the position in order to be an effective leader/coworker. Building relationships that benefit your position and the company as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Leave The Basics At Home</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As we state above, your approach needs to be highly specific to be effective. &ldquo;Familiarizing myself with the office layout&rdquo; or &ldquo;Making friends with neighboring pods&rdquo; should be left out. All the hiring manager cares about is what you can do for the company. Your needs should be left out of the plan except for what you need to be an effective employee. Nothing impresses an interviewer more than a candidate that can quantify their accomplishments. Referencing these accomplishments while presenting your plan can speak volumes to your organizational skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Closing Statement</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some employers will ask you to create a plan similar to this format. If you complete a 30-60-90 day plan for your next interview, you can guarantee you will portray yourself as a very high-quality candidate. Try to include the development of others in your plan (if you are a manager or higher). If you put in the work, this will guarantee that you have done all you can to display your abilities and work ethic. The rest will be out of your control, but using this strategy effectively will eventually lead to results. The process can be long, but the benefits will be worth it! Happy Job Hunting!

If you&rsquo;re planning on making a job change in 2017, here are five things you can do to get your job hunt on track starting today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1) Build or update your career plan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning is a critical factor in business success. If you have read any of my books, watched any of my YouTube videos, read my articles on LinkedIn, or listened to my podcasts, you will likely know that I am a very avid advocate of career planning. Regardless of how you do it, the most important thing is that you invest some time in developing a plan and regularly review and develop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2) Expand your professional network</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that many of the best jobs get filled before they are posted. The more people you know and the more people who know you, the more exposure you will have to opportunities. A mentor of mine always likes to say, &ldquo;It&#39;s all about relationships. It&rsquo;s about the influential people you know and what they say about you when you are not in the room.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/linkedin-networking-tips-for-job-seekers/\"><strong>LinkedIn Networking Tips for Job Seekers</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3) Update your resume to be focused on accomplishments</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The number one problem with most resumes is that they are a list of responsibilities rather than an impactful sales tool for your career that is focused on the things you actually got done. Anyone can list responsibilities on a resume. It&rsquo;s what you actually did that will separate you from others and get you hired.

This is a story that should convey your career goals, philosophies, and values but also and give people a real life glimpse insight into who you are as a candidate and more importantly as a person.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5) Identify a mentor</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, for the early part of my career, I thought mentoring was stupid. After all, I was the smartest person I knew. So how would someone help me? What I realized is that it&rsquo;s not about being smart, it&rsquo;s about being efficient, and mentoring is very efficient. Finding wise and experienced people to give you advice saves a lot of time and frustration. Regardless of if you&rsquo;re currently on the job hunt or considering a move later in 2017, implementing these five strategies today will help get you moving forward with your career.</p>','Mike-Adamo.jpg','2017-01-08 01:37:10','five-things-you-can-do-to-prepare-for-the-best-job-market-in-ten-years','Five Things You Can Do To Prepare For The Best Job Market In Ten Years','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(76,1,'Seven Top Tips for Transitioning from College to Career','So, you’ve graduated from college and are heading to your first full-time job. Yay you! Here are the seven top tips for transitioning from college to career','<p>So you&rsquo;ve finally graduated from college and are heading into your first full-time, &ldquo;real&rdquo; job. Yay you! Here are some tips to maximize your chances for success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Look The Part</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a real mindset shift that needs to occur around your wardrobe as you head into your first full-time job. This often requires an outlay of cash, so think about this as you receive money for graduation gifts. Your parents may be willing to help you out, either as a loan or an outright gift. What you wear to work varies widely with your occupation, setting, even the part of the country you live in. Even if the dress code is&hellip;well, no dress code at all, there are some rules if you want to move up from that entry-level position. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/preparing-for-a-job-interview-what-to-bring-what-to-wear-and-more/\">Preparing For A Job Interview &ndash; What To Bring, What To Wear, &amp; More</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Here are the non-negotiables:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Business casual does not equal &ldquo;sloppy.&rdquo; Clothes must always be clean, in good repair, and work-appropriate. b. Make investments in your wardrobe. Many college students have &ldquo;throw away&rdquo; clothes; this will not serve you well in your career. Better to purchase a few, well-constructed items, rather than 20 pieces that begin to fall apart almost immediately. This applies whether you&rsquo;re wearing suits, business casual, or jeans. c. This one&rsquo;s for the ladies: Sexy and revealing may be great for a Saturday night at the club, but not in a work environment. Opt for conservative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Respect The System</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I hear most often about Millennials in the workplace: they think they know more than the people who&rsquo;ve been there for 20 years, and they want to be in charge of something from day one. Stop rolling your eyes: this perception is not helping your professional image as a team player. Better for you to learn the ropes and politics, and then find small ways in which you can make changes and contribute to improving your work environment. If you act like you&rsquo;re already in charge from day one, you may never actually get a chance to be in charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Offer Your Unique Talents &amp;&nbsp;Skills</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The flip side of point #2 is that you may very well have some areas of expertise&mdash;say technology&mdash;that would greatly benefit your work environment. It&rsquo;s all in the presentation: make sure that, by offering up your ability to revamp the website or set up databases, that you&rsquo;re not inadvertently putting anyone else down. The difference is subtle but important. If the office secretary sees you as someone who is willing to help her with some areas she struggles with and can make her look good in the process, you&rsquo;ll be a hit. If on the other hand, the secretary sees you as someone who doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s capable of doing her job, she will resist any efforts you try to make. Which leads nicely to point #4&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Respect All Employees Regardless Of Their Title</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the previous point, I was talking about how to befriend the office secretary. This is not someone you want to offend. If she likes you, you&rsquo;ll find your life will be much easier. In the same vein, the secretaries you interact with elsewhere in your company, or in other companies you do business with, are also to be respected and seen. They are important people and should be treated as such. Janitors, the mailroom person, the CEO&hellip;treat everyone the way you want to be treated, and you can neither be accused of being a snob or a suck-up. I promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Be A Team Player</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Offer to help others with their projects, offer to take on tasks no one else wants, offer to work on a weekend every now and then&hellip;these are all great ways to be a team player. If you have an issue with a co-worker, be mature enough to have an honest conversation with that individual to try to iron things out. If you make a mistake, say you&rsquo;re sorry. Also, give praise where it&rsquo;s due&mdash;make it specific, appropriate, and heartfelt. If a co-worker conducts 15 minutes of research for you that allow you to complete a report on time, mention it in a staff meeting and watch the co-worker glow. If a co-worker does something much more significant and time-consuming, perhaps treating him or her to lunch would be an appropriate thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Cultivate An Outstanding Reputation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the points I&rsquo;ve already mentioned are pieces of the puzzle when it comes to developing your professional reputation. But there are other pieces, as well: a. Deliver quality results on time and within budget. If either of these pieces is missing, your reputation will suffer. b. Speak with professionalism. What you say, and how you say it, has a huge effect on the way others perceive you. c. Be known as a hard worker. Lazy is a huge career derailer. d. Don&rsquo;t gossip. I can&rsquo;t emphasize this one enough. e. Clean up your social presence. I could spend an hour telling you about people whose careers were derailed by inappropriate photos on Facebook&hellip;it&rsquo;s time to audit your online presence and clean up your act. And remember, your social presence doesn&rsquo;t just mean the absence of negative, but also the presence of positive. Shine Online!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Network, Network, Network</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t spend your lunch cooped up in your office, snacking while working on your computer. Go out with the group after work every once in a while. Are there affinity groups you can participate in at work? Are you able to get involved in the Chamber of Commerce through your employer? There are lots of ways to network, and what is best for you depends on your field, your employer, your personality, and your availability. But you really MUST network.

Everyone wants a 3-page r&eacute;sum&eacute; to show off, but those are hard to read and even easier to pass on. Start with a one-page resume. Highlight your recent degree and include your career objectives at the very top of the page under your name. Your job is to make it extremely obvious to the person reading it: &ldquo;Hey, I just graduated. I have to pay student loans in 6 months, please hire me so I don&rsquo;t have to move back home.&rdquo;. Check out<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/professional-resume-style-headers-fonts-and-themes\">Professional Resume Style - Headers, Fonts, &amp; Themes</a>.</strong> A recruiter or hiring manager only gives most r&eacute;sum&eacute;s an initial 10-30 second glance. So there&rsquo;s no need to make it complicated. Your degree, job objective, internship/previous work experience, and 2-3 unique points are literally all you need to start networking!&nbsp;Make sure to talk about what makes you unique. Saying you are a &quot;quick learner&quot; is something that anybody could put on their resume, try to avoid general statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be one with the Internet:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a millennial/technology guru, you understand that all that matters in life in 2017 is social media. Your LinkedIn profile should read exactly like your resume we discussed above. Just like you grow your network on any other social media platform, you must grow your network of recruiters. Every recruiter for every major brand you identify with is on LinkedIn, otherwise, they would be excommunicated from the industry. The best way to make recruiters aware of your profile is as simple as adding them as a connection. If and when they accept your request, which from my experience the vast majority will. Send a quick message thanking them for connecting. Let them know your objective as a recent graduate looking for an entry-level job. Make sure to include your degree concentration, departments you might be interested in, and a &ldquo;Please keep me in mind for future entry-level roles as they come up.&rdquo; For bonus points: take a look at the company&#39;s current job postings and also the postings on the recruiter&#39;s profile. Recruiters usually have a million things going through their heads, so make it easy for them. If you have the ability to link the job you are interested in along with your r&eacute;sum&eacute; in the intro message, you will really help yourself out! <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/10-best-career-sites-to-land-your-dream-job/\">10 Best Career Sites To Land Your Dream Job</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Quick Tips:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Be open to roles in other departments you may not have an interest in. </strong>Make sure the&nbsp;skills are somewhat transferable to your career path and you identify with the company&#39;s general brand/mission/work environment. Most large companies will move you into a role within your preferred department once an additional headcount is approved as long as you&rsquo;re performing well in your current department within a year or so! <strong>&bull; Keep in touch!</strong> Do yourself a favor by keeping in touch with the internal recruiter that brought you on board. Follow up every month or so to learn about new roles in other departments. Don&rsquo;t forget about all those other recruiters you spoke with during your search. You never know what might happen to your current role or what companies those recruiters might end up working at! <strong>&bull; Don&rsquo;t take just any entry-level role.</strong>&nbsp;As all the stats above indicate, if a company is offering you a position that doesn&rsquo;t fit your &ldquo;vibe&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t be afraid to shop around while respectfully letting the recruiter know that you would like to keep in touch, but aren&rsquo;t interested at this time. You never know when either of you might be able to utilize each other&rsquo;s expertise in the future. Always remember to respect others while building your network!

Few terms in our modern job search environment are more confusing and stress inducing than &quot;Networking&quot;. In today&#39;s hyper-fast, &quot;Gotta go&quot;, selfie society, it&#39;s harder than ever to understand how this helps your job search. And if you&#39;re an introvert like <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomgoettl\">me</a>, the thought of networking can be overwhelming to consider. The purpose of job search networking, of course, is to find someone who can help you find your next opportunity. Whether it is face-to-face or social media networking, the idea is to connect with others who can help you, correct? The short answer, of course, is &quot;yes&quot;. However, I&#39;d like to introduce you to a networking practice that is much easier, more fun, rewarding and productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Pay It Forward Networking</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea here is to first think about how you can help the other person in their career, position or business. What can you do to help them? Who can you introduce them to? Do you know someone that might be interested in their service, company or working in their department? Then think about whom in your network might be interested in connecting with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Social Media Networking.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does this work exactly, you may ask? Let&#39;s say you&#39;re on LinkedIn and notice a Corporate Recruiter at a company you&#39;re interested in posts a new position in your feed. You realize this position clearly isn&rsquo;t in an area that you have experience or interest in. However, you know a few in your LinkedIn network that may have the correct background for the role. Simply share the post and invite your network to review the information. Chances are, the Recruiter will thank you for doing this or at least, view your profile. Either way, you just Networked. When they send you a note, reply with a short &ldquo;You&#39;re Welcome&rdquo; and ask them to keep you in mind for your ideal role. Another LinkedIn option is to write a Recommendation for a former coworkers or supervisor who has moved on to other companies. Authentic and thoughtful recommendations will be remembered and returned. At the same time, your review will be viewed by hundreds, if not thousands in their network.

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re at an actual social gathering such as a birthday party or business event and you meet a new acquaintance that happens to be a supervisor or manager. You learn fairly quickly that their niche isn&#39;t in your wheelhouse of skills. Try asking them questions such as &quot;What types of backgrounds do you look for when hiring in your department?&quot; If you happen to know someone that matches this, offer to introduce him or her via email or social media for networking purposes. Both your new acquaintance and your contact will keep you in mind as they learn of new positions. In another scenario, you meet someone and realize they too are seeking a new position. Take a moment to ask about their career goals and ideal positions. Make a mental note (or note on your phone) of this. Keep this person in mind as you&rsquo;re searching open positions and send a few their way. Start with a couple of these examples and you&#39;re on your way to Pay It Forward Networking. This approach of networking by helping others first can be very rewarding, fulfilling and a fun way to build relationships. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll meet some amazing people and make great connections that will in turn help in your search for your next opportunity.</p>','Describe-A-Time-When-Your-Work-Was-Criticized.jpg','2017-01-10 17:47:27','pay-it-forward-networking','Pay It Forward Networking - Career Advice | Find My Profession','describe a time when your work was criticized','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(79,1,'Describe A Time When Your Work Was Criticized','When being asked to describe a time when your work was criticized, there are a few key points to emphasize and some obvious mistakes to avoid...','<p>Behavioral interview questions can be some of the hardest questions to answer. Often times, there is no right or wrong answer. It&rsquo;s how you frame your answer and what you learned from the experience that is important. When being asked to describe a time when your work was criticized, there are a few key points to emphasize and some obvious mistakes to avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Am I Being Asked This Question?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The secret here is not to avoid answering the question. Believe it or not, you should answer this question with an honest critique that someone made about your work. Whether it was a valid critique or not is another topic. The employer is looking to judge your ability to handle criticism. Did you get angry and tell the person critiquing you to #$%@ off? Or did you own up to your fault and develop a way to improve your work to avoid criticism in the future. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers\">50 Top Job Interview Questions And Answers</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do&rsquo;s</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>-Give a real life example. Explain a situation where a real person gave you a real critique. -Make yourself come off as coachable. Instead of being defensive, use this opportunity to show your critic that you are willing and eager to learn and improve. -Try to give an example that has a positive outcome. If your story starts with someone criticizing you, it should end with your success in improving your performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Don&rsquo;ts:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>-Don&rsquo;t lie! Never make up a story for a hiring manager. The fact is, if you just prepare for the interview questions you will never need to lie. -Focus on the positive outcome. Do not talk poorly about the person criticizing you. Give an example where you improved what was criticized. Don&rsquo;t give an example where the critic was actually wrong with their criticism and you were right. -Don&rsquo;t avoid the answer. Saying that you have never been criticized is foolish. If you can&rsquo;t think of a work example, think of a school project, internship, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Answer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Being only human, I can definitely admit to having received criticism of my work in the past. The only thing you can do at that point is to thank the person for pointing out the flaw. Some people don&rsquo;t like when you tell them they have food on their face. I see it as a way to prevent them from future embarrassment from someone other than myself. Last year, I received criticism from a coworker on my report writing. She did not like how I sent each report in a separate email. Instead, she requested that all emails be sent in one email. I had no idea this was what she preferred. As soon as she told me I was easily able to make the change by compiling all documents into one email. Ever since then, everything has been fantastic between the two of us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S.

So, if you are uncomfortable with approaching others in these situations, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t make a great manager. Your interviewer wants to determine your management skills. Are you awkward? Or do you have the abilities to address issues and motivate others during difficult times?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How&nbsp;to answer this question.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus on your distinct personality traits that make you a great people person. Managers, at least good managers are great with other people. They are well liked, honest, trustworthy, and most importantly, they have the ability to lead in difficult situations. Make sure you emphasize these traits when providing your example. Here are some techniques that a great manager would practice during this situation. <strong>Prepare</strong>. Showing your interviewer that you prepared a strategy before you offered the negative feedback is a great way to show that you care. Not only does it show that you care, it shows you are not an impulsive manager. Lack of preparation in a situation like this could be devastating for yourself, and the person you are offering feedback too. <strong>Stay Constructive!&nbsp;</strong>Although you are having to give someone difficult feedback, make sure to stay positive. Negative feedback is hard enough to hear, make it a little easier by starting the conversation with something good the employee is doing. Many people teach the sandwich approach.Start with positive, then proceed to the negative feedback, then end with something positive. The positive is the bread, and the negative is the meat/cheese. <strong>Be Specific</strong>. One of the worst things that you could do during your interview is be too vague. Feel free to provide specifics wherever possible. You should tell the whole story, so the employer knows the situations leading up to your negative feedback, as well as the positive outcome that resulted from your feedback. <strong>Act Comfortable</strong>. I cannot tell you how many people get awkward in these sorts of situations. Even if you are a little awkward with the actual negative feedback, DO NOT make it seem that way in the interview. The hiring manager is going to want to know that you are extremely comfortable in these sorts of situations. Someone who second guesses their judgment and feedback will not make for a great leader. Be firm with your feedback, but remember to keep it constructive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You Got This!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, this question is a walk in the park! You are going to do just fine. If you only remember one sentence from this article, remember to Prepare, Stay Constructive, Be Specific, and Act Comfortable.

Now you might be asking “Why did I choose that Major?!','<p>So you have a French History degree, but want to enter into the business world? Now you might be asking &ldquo;Why did I choose that Major?!&rdquo; We can promise that those 4-5 years you spent chasing that piece of paper did not go to waste! Regardless of your major choice, the fact that you completed the program bodes well for you. The best part of this question being asked is you are already in an interview! That is 87% of the battle! There is absolutely no right or wrong answer here, but you should have a well thought-out response ready.

It drives us crazy when someone says &ldquo;Oh, I just went to some small no name school&rdquo;&hellip; YOU STILL HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE!!! Although your major may not relate to your career path, you picked the subject for a reason. Go into detail about your thought process choosing said major and how you have become a better person. Some say avoid personal responses in interviews and for the most part, we agree. This question has room to get a little personal as it relates to a dream or aspiration you have/had. It&rsquo;s okay if you need to get personal with your answer to explain your choice. Just don&rsquo;t go overboard and dump your life story on the hiring manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Relate Your Skill Set</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not specialized for a given industry, you will still have relatable skills that you can expand on. Studying the job description beforehand will help you make the connection to what you have to offer. Concentrate on ANY past experience that you have had that relates to the open position. Many candidates will stretch the truth so if you are not effective, you will not be hired. Being a college grad, you had to make deadlines, work long hours, and multitask to graduate. All these skills can relate to almost any job. It is up to you to make the correlation and translate these skills in an organized manner. Remember, this is not a trick question and there is no wrong answer. Preparation is the only way to ensure you will not be thrown by any question the hiring manager chooses.

This is a growing frustration as a gap in your work history begins to expand. Gaps in employment can happen to almost anyone, so don&rsquo;t lose all hope just yet! There are many reasons an employment gap can happen. Obviously, some reasons are better than others, but most can be twisted into a positive light. Following the below should help you on your journey to end that hated gap!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Life Happens!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What you choose to do with your life is completely up to you&hellip; With that said, you may have to deal with repercussions of your decisions. Okay, enough with the parental lecture. We say that because a gap is a gap whether you go to prison or a 6-month backpacking trip. Whatever the reason for your gap is, you must try and spin it into a growing point as a person. This may turn into a pretty personal question depending on your circumstances, but you should be able to discuss it. The goal of this question is to see if you understand the concerns of a job gap. A hiring manager will assume you chose not to work if you do not explain otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be Honest</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lying during the interview process can have obvious negative implications. Please do not make-up positions you have held to close gaps in employment. During your gap, research resources at your disposal to assist in training and courses to help better your experience.

A job hopper is not as bad...','<p>So, you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;job hopper&rdquo;&hellip; If so, the question, &quot;Why have you changed jobs so frequently&quot; may take a more strategic response. A job hopper is not as bad now as it was 20 years ago so there is still hope! Although you have not found the right &ldquo;fit&rdquo; yet, loyalty is still very important to employers. You must be able to convince a hiring manager that you can commit to their company. There are many ways you can use job hopping to your advantage while in the interview process. By following the below guidelines, you can answer this question in a positive light.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reasons Outside Of Your Control</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have been laid off in the past, this is not job hopping. Job hopping is quitting positions voluntarily to pursue other options one may have. The problem with this is many people&nbsp;chase a similar opportunity without any advancement with a different company. This is a red flag to a hiring manager as it shows you are not happy with any position you hold. Regardless of what you have done in the past, build your response around something you could not control. Now, we are not saying to lie as work situations have many factors that can affect you personally. This is assuming you have held each job for more than a couple months. If you have changed jobs more than once a year, you have some explaining to do!

Ideally! If you cannot show that your skills have developed with each job, this question will be tough. Try and relate specifics from each of your job titles and explain why you are the perfect fit for the position. If you are a new grad, job hopping can just mean you are looking for the right fit. Well, how do you know that the company you are applying for is right for you now? At some point, you should question your career path if you are constantly changing jobs. If this opportunity does suit you well, you must be convincing as to why.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s Not Over&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a chronic job hopper, there is still hope! You are at an advantage considering you have seen multiple company cultures and operating styles. This experience can be very helpful in a newer company or a company looking for a facelift. Use the checklist below to structure your answer. This will give you the best opportunity to change a negative on your resume into a positive for the company!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>1. Do NOT show that you left a similar position multiple times!</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Example - quitting an executive assistant position for another. Try changing the job titles and include varying responsibilities if similar positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>2.&nbsp;Show advancement!</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Include any additional responsibilities gained from company to company. Consider ALL skills you have acquired and relate them to the requirements of the position you are applying for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>3.&nbsp;Explain realistic reasons for leaving and have a story to back them up!</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Be prepared to go into detail as the hiring manager will likely explore deeper. Lying will most likely hurt your chances further so don&rsquo;t stray too far from the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>4.&nbsp;Show future dedication!</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Explain why this job is the end of your job seeking endeavors. If the job is not the right fit, consider a possible career change. Now that you have the keys to answering this tough question, build your response. Show that you understand your lack of commitment in the past. This will show growth and maturity in your professional career. Hopefully, you are on the right track to finding your dream career.

Whatever the case is, we are going to show you how to answer the question, &quot;have you ever been convicted of a felony&quot; with ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>If Your Answer Is: No</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This makes things very simple!

The fact of the matter is, what&rsquo;s done is done. Unless you can invent a time machine, you need to learn how to make the best of your situation. There are 3 top tips to remember when searching for a job with a felony charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Be Honest</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Please, please, please do not lie! If you are being asked this question, chances are you are going to be given a background check. You will save yourself and the hiring manager some time by being honest. There are some jobs that are simply unwilling to hire someone with a felony. The sooner you accept this reality the better. BUT, there are still a ton of amazing jobs that will never ask you this question. Just be honest. If a company doesn&rsquo;t want to hire you just because of a dumb mistake you made years ago, then they do not deserve you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Show Remorse</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I understand it might be a little embarrassing admitting you have a felony. Maybe you are considering just lying about the felony, finishing the interview, and never following up about the job. That way, nobody ever finds out you have a felony, and you save yourself the embarrassment. Don&rsquo;t do that&hellip; Believe it or not, there are many hiring managers that are willing to work with your felony. The most important thing is that you show remorse. Admitting to your felony is a great start, but don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;Yea, I did it. I have a felony.&rdquo; Explain how you have changed. Assure the hiring manager that you regret your decisions, have learned from them, and that feel you are a better person from the life experiences that you have had. I can assure you that your chances of landing a job would be much higher when you show remorse, then when you don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Apply To Other Jobs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a last resort, you can always apply to other jobs. Trust me, there are plenty of companies out there who will never ask if you have a felony. I personally do not have a felony, but I have worked at multiple amazing companies that 1) never asked this question and 2) never conducted a background check. Don&rsquo;t get caught up in one position. There are thousands of jobs becoming available every single day. Don&rsquo;t feel like you must settle for a job you will be unhappy with. Dealing with a felony is enough of a struggle without having to think about the impact that it will have on your career. So, don&rsquo;t let it have an impact on your career! Be motivated to find your dream job, and don&rsquo;t let that felony get in the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Need Some Help?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We are so confident in your qualifications and could care less about your criminal background.

However, I have seen how planning without true vision can lead to misery.','<p>Planning has always been the secret sauce for me when it comes to all areas of my life. However, I have seen how planning without true vision can lead to misery. Yes, planning works when you stick to your plan, but it is the vision that glues us to our commitments and holds our feet to the fire. Visualization is a powerful tool, and for years I knew of the power of visualization without truly understanding the power of having a vision. In my late teens, I read <strong><em>Creative Visualization</em>: <em>Use the Power of Your Imagination to Create What You Want in Your Life</em></strong> by Shakti Gawain. I loved how I could use visualization to make changes in how I felt about myself and in my life. Unfortunately, once I got into the thick of my career and felt bogged down by stress and uncertainty, it took me many years to apply those lessons to create a vision for my career. I first had to realize that a vision was what I was missing. I was going through the motions because I knew I would need money to survive, while all the time feeling miserable and lacking fulfillment. As we grow in our careers it is important that we start to develop and focus on our vision for our careers and personal lives. As creators of our future, how can we successfully manifest the life we want to live if we ourselves are unsure of what we are creating? This uncertainty allows us to be blown in many directions and takes our power away. We begin to think that our career success depends on our bosses or teams, company or even the economy, when all along we have the power to reinvent, readjust, and create success within our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Discover Your Vision</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in taking our power back is having a strong vision. Companies use vision statements as road maps to guide their initiatives and company direction. You too should have a vision statement that serves as a guiding force in your career. A vision statement that expresses your optimal goal and the impact you are looking to make is a major step in career planning.It will support your career in immeasurable ways, from deciding which industries to target to deciding the next step on your career path. Discovering your vision comes from having the courage to question yourself and what you want while tuning out outside influences, such as society, our parents, friends, and family. Without even realizing it we internalize the feelings and thoughts of others daily. It takes going within for us to see where certain limitations originated. The thought that we couldn&#39;t make it as an artist or pursue a certain path starts with something we were told or read. An outside influence told us that we weren&rsquo;t good enough or that something was impossible and we built our careers around that notion. <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/10-best-career-sites-to-land-your-dream-job/\"><strong>10 Best Career Sites To Land Your Dream Job</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Imagine&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine what our careers would look like if we didn&rsquo;t put limitations on ourselves. If we didn&rsquo;t think of our careers as just a tool to make money and gain influence, but as a way to express our gifts and make a positive impact on the people around us. Spend some time really imagining your career. What your day looks like, what impact you have, how you feel. Imagine it in the context of your whole life. Where are you waking up? What time is it? Who are you lying next to?&nbsp;Our careers affect all areas of our life and should not be thought of as separate from our personal lives.&nbsp;Our careers are essentially our &ldquo;life&rsquo;s work&rdquo;, and we must think about it in relation to our whole lives because it touches all the pieces of our personal space. All of us at a young age had a vision of what we thought &ldquo;work&rdquo; or our careers would look like. Maybe it was based on what we saw our parents do, or on things we observed on television. But, I know I wasn&rsquo;t the only one playing teacher/doctor/nurse while growing up. For years, I thought that if I didn&rsquo;t make it as an actor my backup job would be as a Systems Analyst since that is what my mother did. Never mind that I really had no idea what a Systems Analyst did or that I wasn&rsquo;t even into computers at the time. It was through tapping into what I was really interested in and good at that I decided what I was going to pursue in school and in my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Write It Down</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve gotten the picture, write it down. Another book that was a great influence over how I thought about my life and career is <strong><em>Write it Down, Make it Happen</em></strong> by Henriette Klauser. I read this book in college and it helped open my eyes to the power of writing down goals, thoughts, and dreams. Ask yourself, what are you passionate about, how do you enjoy spending your time, and write down the answers. Write down your long and short term goals, and what your top priorities are for the next 6 months. These are the questions that are going to form the base of your plan. The power in having a solid plan is that it takes out all the guesswork when it comes to how you should be spending your time and effort. Removing stress goes a long way towards making your job search a bearable experience and may even infuse a little fun into the process. Your vision for your career should be the driving force behind this plan of action. Do a clear assessment of your career now and how it aligns with your goals for your life and career. Research the career path for someone in your industry. Does that speak to the direction that you would like to take your career? Explore other career paths and see how they tie into your experience and goals. Dedicating time to career-related research will support the planning process. This should include online research as well as networking and talking to industry professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Create Your Plan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From this space of knowledge, you can make a job search or career plan that speak to your needs while taking into consideration the needs and values of the industry you are looking to advance in. This will also support the next step in planning, gathering and assessing crucial resources. Ask yourself what you need to make this plan a success: a new resume or updated LinkedIn profile, or perhaps, more education such as a certification or hands on experience. Once you know what resources you need set dates for acquiring them. Dates are very important when planning, they serve as motivation and a way to track progress. Now you can assess what your priorities are and set dates and plans of action. Arrange your goals with the top priorities on your list first, and under each goal list the resources that are needed. If you have all the resources, then you can move on to planning the bigger goal. But, if a crucial resource is missing start there and create the preliminary steps to acquire the resources. Start with setting a date for completion. After setting a deadline, list all the things that need to happen to complete this goal. Add a completion date for each of these smaller tasks, again dates are so important. Now break down how much time you will spend on this goal on a daily and weekly basis. Are there tasks that need to be completed daily or weekly, such as setting up informational interviews or networking? If so, make note of those too. I find that having a daily list of actions is a great way to stay on track. It also brings a sense of accomplishment when we complete all our tasks. Learn the secrets &nbsp;-<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/\">How To Apply For Jobs Online</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Take Your Power Back</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this should be written down. Plans that are only kept in your mind can be easily forgotten or ignored. This is why it&rsquo;s best to not only write the plan down&nbsp;but to share it with someone you respect. Try to make it someone that you would mind disappointing. Often times we will break a commitment with ourselves before we will break it with another person. This person can be a mentor, friend, family member or coach. Just having someone to hold you accountable is a great way to increase productivity. After a while, some of us stop dreaming and creating our vision in favor of what we believe is a more practical view of our career. The problem with this more practical view is that it rarely has us in control of our career. However, through creating a clear vision and plan we can take our power back. Start with having a clear vision of what you want to create. Create a thorough plan with dates. And get ready to enjoy a more fulfilling and joyous career.</p>','Jasmine-Briggs.jpg','2017-01-13 06:24:35','the-power-of-vision-focused-planning','The Power Of Vision Focused Planning | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(86,1,'Bringing a Winning Mindset to the Interview','You know how critical it will be to prepare for the interview, but where do you start? How do you ensure you will present your best self in the interview?','<p>So far everything has fallen into place for your dream job. Your &lsquo;kick-ass&rsquo; r&eacute;sum&eacute; captured the attention of the hiring manager. You nailed the initial phone screen, and now you&rsquo;ve been invited in for an in-person interview. You know how critical it will be to prepare for the interview, but where do you start? How do you ensure you will present your best self in the interview? Most savvy job seekers will naturally prepare for an important job interview by researching the company, studying the company website, familiarizing themselves with the job description and essential job functions, and practicing answering difficult interview questions. But, to truly prepare for a job interview, it&rsquo;s crucial that you take some time to prepare the appropriate mindset. Here are 5 important things to remember as you prepare for the job interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They already like you and believe you can do the job.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiring manager has already read your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and in most cases, spoken with you via telephone. It&#39;s clear that you can do the job and have something valuable to contribute to the success of the company. If not, they wouldn&rsquo;t be talking to you. So, you can step into the interview with complete confidence that you are actually being considered for the position. They didn&rsquo;t grant you the interview just to be nice. They really want to meet you. In fact, they may be as excited about what you have to offer as you are about the opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They want you to do a good job on the interview.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of job seekers view a job interview as a big test that they will be very lucky to pass. When they think about job interviews, their palms sweat, and their stomachs turn as they imagine being grilled with tricky questions that they must answer correctly in order to pass. Step back and view the situation from the standpoint of the hiring manager. The hiring process is stressful for everyone, especially the hiring manager. Vacancies on a team affect productivity and morale. Filling the position with a great candidate is their focus. And they have a good feeling you&rsquo;re the stellar, high-performer they will be excited to add to the team. Hiring managers have no interest in interviewing (and deflating the confidence of) nervous job seekers for sport.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The interview is about what you can do for them.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to preparing mindset for an interview, this idea is paramount. The hiring manager is going to ask a lot of questions that seem like they are about you:<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-is-your-dream-job/\"> What do <strong><em>you </em></strong>look for in a job?</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/why-do-you-want-to-work-here/\">Why do <u><em><strong>you</strong> </em></u>want to work for us?</a>&nbsp;How long will <u><em><strong>you</strong> </em></u>stay with us? These questions seem like they focus on what you want and that is true&hellip;to a point. But, as you answer these questions, you must convey that what you really want is to contribute to the success of the organization and to be a part of a team. Making a contribution and being a part of the company&rsquo;s success must be more important than getting your foot in the door and advancing your career. Responding to questions in a manner that conveys an over interest in personal security can be detrimental to your success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The interview is more like a blind date than a sales call.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s important to sell yourself in a job interview, an overly &ldquo;salesy&rdquo; mindset can convey an attitude of desperation. A job interview is much like a blind date. The hiring manager expresses interest in you, and you express interest in the company and the position. The interview is an opportunity for each of you to confirm mutual interest and determine whether or not that interest merits taking things to the next level. Communicate your interest and put your best foot forward, but do not oversell. Desperation is never attractive on a blind date and certainly not in a job interview. And remember, your first dates are more successful when you are interested in learning more about the other person. So prepare to ask thoughtful questions and engage in meaningful conversation with the hiring manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be yourself and answer questions honestly.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, the best answer to any question is the answer you arrive at most authentically and organically. Too often, job seekers will go into an interview believing they need to answer questions with &ldquo;the correct answer&rdquo; or that they need to embody a particular image or persona to win the job. In any other professional situation, they show up with complete confidence, but in a job interview, for some reason, they believe they need to play a particular role. This faulty mindset likens the job interview to a &ldquo;game&rdquo; or &ldquo;contest,&rdquo; and those who play it are seldom winners. Consider for a moment that you are impressive enough without having to be anyone other than who you are. In other words, the hiring manager really wants to know what <u>you</u> think and what <u>you</u> have to say, so speak with self-assurance. You want to leave the interview believing that you presented yourself confidently and feeling good about the conversation, not wondering if they would have liked the real you better. Viewed properly, a job interview is really just a conversation between two potential colleagues or strategic partners. It is an opportunity to learn, to share ideas, and to meet other professionals. With the appropriate preparation and mindset, the interview process can be a valuable way of building your professional network, even if you don&rsquo;t land the job. And, it might even be fun!</p>','Bringing-a-Winning-Mindset-to-the-Interview.jpg','2017-01-13 06:43:14','bringing-a-winning-mindset-to-the-interview','Bringing A Winning Mindset To The Interview | Find My Profession','Bringing A Winning Mindset To The Interview','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(87,1,'Tell Me About A Time You Did Something Wrong.

That&rsquo;s definitely something that you will want to do, but you also need to prepare for the worst. It can be a shocking surprise when you walk into an interview expecting to talk about how great you are, and someone asks you to tell them about a time you did something wrong. There is a reason you are being asked this question, so it&rsquo;s important that you take some time to familiarize yourself with the main points to emphasize, and some common mistakes to avoid. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">50 Top Job Interview Questions and Answers</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Main Points To Emphasize</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Focus on how you handled the situation. Instead of giving a ton of information on what you did wrong, give just enough insight to go into detail on how you positively handled the situation. &bull; Stay Positive! &bull; Express self-development and growth. Just because you did something wrong in the past does not mean that you have not grown and learned from your mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes To Avoid</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Avoid being negative! Although this is a negative question, you want to focus on the positive. &bull; Don&rsquo;t claim to be perfect. Saying that you have never done something wrong is just ridiculous and a sure way to eliminate yourself. &bull; Avoid dragging a coworker into the situation. Try to focus on something that YOU did wrong, and how YOU handled it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Answer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A couple years ago, my manager came into my office and asked me why she had not received my most recent report. I explained that I had sent the report over, and had absolutely no idea why she had not received it. She then asked me to resend it as soon as possible. The next day, she asked me why I had still not sent the report over. Again, I said that I did. Finally, after doing some digging, I had realized that I was sending the report via my personal email address, instead of my work email address. This was causing my report to go directly to my manager&rsquo;s spam box. As soon as I found out, I informed my manager of the problem and resent the report on my work email. Since then, I have been extremely careful about what email account I use.&rdquo; Check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a>&nbsp;</strong>for all of the latest career advice.

When you are looking for a new job, it&rsquo;s important that the next company you work for is a good fit. The interviewer feels the same way about who they hire. Eventually, you are going to be asked to &ldquo;describe a time you disagreed with a coworker.&rdquo; The reason you might be asked this question&nbsp;is to determine whether you are a team player, flexible, and influential. Don&rsquo;t worry! Everyone has disagreed with a coworker at one time or another. This isn&rsquo;t a trick question. The correct answer is NOT, &ldquo;I get along with everybody and have never disagreed with a coworker.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s definitely NOT, &ldquo;Nobody disagrees with me because I am always right!&rdquo; <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/preparing-for-a-job-interview-what-to-bring-what-to-wear-and-more\">Preparing For A Job Interview &ndash; What To Bring, What To Wear, &amp; More</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be A Leader - Listen</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A good leader is not someone who uses force to get what they want. A good leader can influence others around them by being a team player, flexible, and influential. To be all of these things, it&rsquo;s important to also be a good listener. One of the most basic yet effective conflict resolution techniques is to sit two people down, and simply take turns sharing why they feel the way they do. No, I am not saying that you and your coworker need to go see a therapist together. But when you are answering this question in an interview, it is important to show off your leadership skills. Take the initiative to ask your coworker what it is that they disagree with. Once you understand what it is they disagree with, it will be a lot easier to find a solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Answer &ndash; Describe A Time You Disagreed With A Coworker</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;About a year ago, a coworker and I had a disagreement about whom a specific account belonged too.

However, many online job boards are content aggregate websites. They exist only to take content from another website and place it on their own. You need another set of eyes watching job boards to know the difference between legit job boards and content aggregate sites! The one perfect job application you sent in today on an aggregate website could have gone to waste. Find My Profession applies to jobs online for you which saves you time. The time you save can be used for job applications asking you to construct a cover letter. Others will ask you to create an account on their business&rsquo; website to fill out a new job application form.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Targeting your&nbsp;online resume for job boards and LinkedIn.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The old saying goes, &ldquo;A person who represents himself has a fool for a client&rdquo;. Hiring trends change more frequently throughout our careers than most people spend job seeking. On average a worker may change jobs 10 times before age 40. Today&rsquo;s workforce will see an average of 15 job changes before age 40. Hiring trends, however, change every year. &nbsp; Therefore, the resume that helped you nail down a great job 3 years ago may be out of date. It may not be friendly with the&nbsp;technology used by recruiters. The usage of format and keywords in resumes changes as well. Recruiters at Find My Profession are aware of changing trends in hiring. Job seekers discover what works on resumes when applying for jobs through job boards. They discover the importance of presentation of a resume on platforms such as LinkedIn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>You have someone to discuss the sketchy side of online job applications.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than desirable hiring companies often use specific keywords out of context to garner more job applicants. Job applicants often discover after applying that the job description was misleading. Words like &ldquo;brand management&rdquo; can be used in job descriptions for &ldquo;street promotions&rdquo;. However, these jobs are completely different and require two different skill sets. For example, I saw a recent series of job postings on a popular job board under the job title, &ldquo;Customer Service Manager&rdquo;. After investigating, the jobs turned out to be for an independent telemarketing work from home and handing out food samples at a supermarket chain. The word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; is being used to describe people managing their own workloads, which is something we all do. We are not all &ldquo;managers&rdquo;, however. Words taken out of context can lead to hours of misleading job interviews for entry-level positions. Find My Profession applies to jobs having your best interest in mind. Prior to doing so, job seekers have discussions with Find My Profession about what should go on a resume to avoid such situations. &nbsp;This requires discussions about &ldquo;what is happening on job boards&rdquo;. Websites like Glassdoor are useful for business reviews, but you contend with false reviews contributed by company employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The opportunity to do A/B testing of resumes.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to do A/B testing I have the following: 1. My resume from Find My Profession which I trust is getting out there. It is the representation of what I want out of my next job. 2. My presentation of a resume which I use on my own. Resumes are subjected to personal recruiter&rsquo;s opinion. I apply for jobs on my own and change up the presentation. By doing this, I discovered different parts of the world seemed more attracted to certain styles of resume presentations than others. Note: Giving appropriate credit, the resume I worked on with Find My Profession has led to the most job interviews. In the process, I learned a move to a new city may be required for my career transition. The west coast of the United States may be my next land of opportunity!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The simplest reason why: avoiding spam.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Many online job postings ask you to share your personal information and email when applying. Sounds like a great &ldquo;job opportunity&rdquo;, but within minutes you are hounded with spam. You are offered services and online education programs. You just gave your information to a sales representative by mistake. It then becomes next to impossible to stop the spam and the &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; button is useless. This does not happen with Find My Profession. The more I talk with Find My Profession the more I learn about the differences between real job opportunities and spam job listings. Find My Profession is a human company. It is unfortunate that many websites pose as job boards and then spam you, but it does happen. It simply pays to know what you are looking at before you forfeit your personal information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>In closing&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Searching for work online is a full-time job. The process involves rejection and can feel long and drawn out. It is important to keep human assistance in your life during a job hunt to combat the feelings that come with a full-time job of being rejected until you find your dream job. You receive reassurance that you are not in the job seeking game alone. After all, your success matters as much to you as it does to <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com\">Find My Profession. </a></strong></p>','steven-lowell.jpg','2017-01-21 01:41:36','5-reasons-it-pays-to-get-help-applying-for-jobs','5 Reasons It Pays To Get Help Applying For Jobs | Find My Profession',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(90,1,'What Academic Courses Did You Like The Most/Least?','When you obtain a degree, you are forced to take a variety of courses... When asked what academic courses did you like the most/least it is important....','<p>When you obtain a degree, you are forced to take a variety of courses that you may not have an interest in. During an interview, you may have to discuss the academic courses that you like the most and least. No matter your stance before the class, you may have found that the subject was informational and interesting. But on the other hand, I can think of some classes that downright stunk! This is an open-ended question so follow the below tips to ensure you avoid negative answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>(Subject)ive Answers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We would never advise you to blatantly lie in an interview. There is a difference between lying and strategically aligning your answers with the requirements of the position. No harm is done if you state that you recollect enjoying the classes that require relatable skills. Ideally, you have a degree that relates to your desired industry. If not, you may have to do a little stretching, but this question does not have one right answer. See our article regarding the interview question <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/why-did-you-choose-your-major/\">Why Did You Choose Your Major?</a></strong> Make sure you study the Job Requirements before your interview. This will provide you the resources you need to create your ideal answer relating to classes you have taken. Explain how the challenges in certain classes made you better personally and professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stay Positive</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this question asks for courses you like the least, you can still answer positively. Make sure your answer involves courses that do not relate to the position whatsoever. You want the hiring manager to know that you are passionate about the opportunity and won&rsquo;t quit out of boredom. As you explain why you did not like a particular class, focus on the subject specifically. Not having an interest in a particular subject is perfectly normal. Do NOT blame a professor for a certain grade or claim they were boring&hellip; This will most likely portray you as a negative person.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Make The Connection</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A great strategy is to follow up by asking the interviewer what courses they had an interest in. That way you can expand on different courses and experiences you both have. Anything you can do to leave a positive impression on the hiring manager will help separate you from other candidates. By connecting your coursework to the skills required, you are emphasizing your qualifications. This should be done with as many questions as possible throughout your interview. Keep it positive and get the job! We know&hellip; Easier said than done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Answer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a business student, I really enjoyed the many management courses I was able to take. I met a lot of great people and learned many skills that I use in my profession. I specifically found a passion for operations management and have never looked back. Because of this, I feel I would be a great fit for your management team and this company as a whole. As far as classes I didn&rsquo;t like, one jumps out immediately. I had a film class that was a night course and 3 hours long. We watched black and white movies during each class and at first, I felt it was a waste of time. I then gave in and paid attention and realized they were all pretty great movies! By the end of the course, I realized it was one of my favorite classes of the semester.

Be honest when an interviewer asks &ldquo; Give me an example of a time you did something wrong.

Use the below guidelines to answer this question without ruining your chances of landing your dream job!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you blew a sale or sent a client the wrong invoice, accept the mistake and move on! It may be difficult to discuss, but there is nothing wrong with that. Discussing mistakes will help you grow as a person and allow you to make adjustments in the future. This question is not so much about what you did wrong, rather how you handled it. Discussing how you realized you messed up and worked to fix your mistake is much more important. Be humble and fess up! For more about speaking on your weaknesses in interviews, see our article <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-weaknesses/\">What Are Your Weaknesses?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CHOOSE WISELY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure that you don&rsquo;t select a catastrophic example of a time you messed up. Rule of thumb: if you got fired because of it, pick a different story! Try and pick a scenario that you and your boss were able to laugh about afterward. This will give you the best opportunity to find common ground with the interviewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SHOW GROWTH</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to explain how you have grown professionally from your mistakes. You should be able to discuss your mistake with others in order to improve. You will be able to create steps to mitigate the chance of the same mistake happening again. Explaining what you learned from these mistakes will show the interviewer all they need to know. Structure your answer into a cause and effect type of approach and conclude it with what you learned. You will separate yourself from other candidates if you deliver this response with confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAMPLE ANSWER</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I was a bank teller when a customer came in requesting a sheet of checks. When I went to print them out, another banker printed similar checks for another client. Without looking, I handed the wrong checks to the client. She then wrote a check to pay her rent and the funds were eventually pulled from the other client&rsquo;s account. This was not figured out until the customer called and complained that their funds were missing. The clients actually reconciled this between themselves and were able to laugh afterward. I then developed a system to make sure that I triple check the name before handing any client a sheet of checks.

If you haven&rsquo;t (or maybe you were the person not pulling the weight) just put yourself in the shoes of someone who has experienced this. Mostly everybody has a story when this happened. Whether it was at work, a school project or a sports team, the most important part is that you frame your answer in a positive light.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Answers To Emphasize</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>-<strong>Be a solution seeker!</strong> Show your interviewer the steps that you took to find a solution. Did you have a 1 on 1 conversation with this team member and explain how you felt? That&rsquo;s a start! -<strong>Be understanding</strong>. You never know what the reason is someone may not be pulling their weight. Showing the interviewer that you took the time to understand the person&#39;s reasoning will show that you are a reasonable person. If there is not a valid reason at all for the lack of effort, then it&rsquo;s time to try something else. -<strong>Be strategic</strong>. When answering this question, the most important part is to focus on your strengths. What strengths will allow you to handle or address the situation? Was it your patience? Mediation skills? Leadership and influence? Whatever it is, make sure you make it apparent to your interviewer that these traits you possess resulted in a positive outcome! -<strong>Be Positive</strong>. I don&rsquo;t care what example you give, or what the actual solution was. Don&rsquo;t ever tell the interviewer that after all your efforts the person continued to slack off. If your story doesn&rsquo;t have a happy ending, then it is not worth telling.

It is already apparent that someone was not pulling their weight. The purpose of this question is not to criticize this team member. -<strong>Don&rsquo;t be a tattle-tale</strong>. Nobody wants to hear that you went and told on this teammate when he/she was not pulling their weight. This shows that you can&rsquo;t handle situations on your own. And that you have no regard for the manager&rsquo;s time by asking them to mitigate this problem. -<strong>Don&rsquo;t be a pushover!</strong> Telling your interviewer that you took the slack and picked up the extra work for your coworker (while not the worst thing you could say) is not recommended! -<strong>Avoid saying nothing.</strong> You are obviously being asked this question because the interviewer assumes/expects you to have some experience working in teams.

Having worked in teams quite frequently in my previous position, it was inevitable that this situation would arise. Last year, I was assigned to work with the marketing team to create a marketing plan for a large account. Each member of this team was assigned a specific task that was to be completed by our set deadline. One of the members was way behind and said that he probably could not finish his section of the project in time. I sat down with him to understand why he was unable to finish his portion of the project. After all, this was what we committed too and we all had equal parts. He explained to me that he had been having internet trouble, and was unable to complete his research at home. For the next couple minutes, we brainstormed different places he could go to use the internet. After addressing this situation, he had agreed to work in Starbucks, in order to complete his portion by the deadline.Taking the time to understand his situation, and figure out a solution was critical to our project completion. At the end, we were all able to finish our work on time, and the project was completed successfully.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S.

Why would they ask, “Can you tell me about a time you faced a difficult situation with a colleague?\"','<p>UH-OH, another behavioral question! Why would they ask &ldquo;Can you tell me about a time you faced a difficult situation with a colleague?&rdquo; Obviously, the wording can vary, but the strategy behind the question is the same. Behavioral questions are asked to see how you would react to certain situations if you are hired. Just because the hiring manager is asking a negative question, does not mean you can&rsquo;t give a positive answer! Basically, you need to express that you can settle conflicts in a professional manner. This should not be difficult as it is always unacceptable to handle any altercation in any other way. Use the below guidelines to structure your answer and separate yourself from the other candidates. For a similar scenario, see our article <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/have-you-ever-had-trouble-working-with-a-manager/\"><u>Have You Ever Had Trouble Working With A Manager?</u></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Conflicts come about in the workplace quite frequently. If you have been able to avoid conflicts and have gotten along with all your coworkers, nice work! You then would be able to describe these scenarios and your answer would be positive. The only problem with this is the hiring manager may think you do whatever necessary to avoid conflict. Not a good trait if you work in a competitive industry. If this sounds like you, we would advise you mentally put yourself in a difficult situation. This will give you the opportunity to create a conflict resolution scenario and provide the solution you think is best. If you are like most of us, we are sure that you have many conflicts you have experienced in the workplace. Just because &quot;conflict&quot; is a negative word, positive resolutions are often the result! Ideas are challenged constantly, and usually for the better. If you can use this mindset to answer your question, you should be able to spin this question. Now if a colleague is throwing a fit and yelling obscenities, this is a situation you want to avoid describing! You want to express your professionalism while showing you do not fear common workplace conflicts. Ideally, you have a story of you and a coworker disagreeing and then working together to find a solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CLOSING THOUGHTS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can include the above, you should be able to form an adequate answer. There are some other factors that you can expand on to strengthen your response. Try to show your ability in identifying possible conflicts. This will speak volumes to your awareness of factors that can lead to conflicts. Also, showing the maturity to know that you only have control of yourself will give that extra boost to your answer. The hiring manager will believe that you will mind your business and act in a professional manner if hired. See our example answer below!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>EXAMPLE ANSWER</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At my previous employer, we would have weekly board meetings and tension would rise on occasion. So much so, that people would begin raising their voices and on some occasions, even crying. I was sure to check my emotions at the door. If voices were raised and it was my turn to talk, I made sure that I spoke in a professional manner and at a normal speaking volume.

Read below to see how to navigate this cryptic question.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We would never advise to blatantly lie in an interview, but omitting the truth can help in this scenario. When an interviewer asks about possible negative workplace scenarios, you should always answer in a positive light.

You can use that experience to positively express how you have received motivation by these employers. This can also provide the opportunity to relate your experience with the job description. Provide examples of how managers have pushed you in the past to grow as a professional in your industry. Any chance you get, relate your skills and experiences to the requirements of the position you are applying for. This will ensure that you will leave a positive and lasting impression!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAMPLE ANSWERS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>1. I have been lucky enough to have a string of great employers.

This is your opportunity to showcase how amazing you are at critical thinking, problem-solving, and making a positive impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Things To Remember</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keep it work related.</strong> If you had an extremely difficult decision to make recently that had to do with family or friends, keep it to yourself. Even if that is truly &ldquo;the most difficult decision you have made&rdquo;. It is better to move on to the second or third most difficult decision as long as it relates to work. <strong>Provide an example that results in something positive.</strong> Remember, you want to showcase your critical thinking and problem solving skills. If you give an example with a negative ending, that will probably reflect poorly these skills. <strong>Showcase your skills.</strong> The entire purpose of this question is for the interviewer to learn about your thinking process behind making decisions. Are you someone who doesn&rsquo;t think things through? Do you just &ldquo;wing it&rdquo; and get lucky? Or are you the type of person who has a rhyme or reason for the things you do? For the sake of the interview, at least pretend that you put some thought into your decision.

Pick the decision that is going to showcase your skills, regardless of if it was actually the most difficult decision you have made.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Here is a slightly tweaked example from LiveCareer.</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Two years ago I was offered the opportunity to move up within my company.

Because of this, it is very important that you have a sample answer in the holster. This question is common because a company does not want to hire real average employees! By following the below guidelines, you will ensure that you provide a quality answer that leaves a positive impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WHY THEY ARE ASKING&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing why an interviewer is asking a question can better help you provide the answer they are looking for. With this question, the answer is simple&hellip; Are you hardworking? The problem you may have is understanding what the hiring manager&rsquo;s definition of hardworking is. When rehearsing your answer, make sure that you did, in fact, go above and beyond! If you worked at McDonald&rsquo;s and gave a customer two napkins instead of one, pick a different example. If you have trouble thinking of a good story, see our example towards the end of the article!

Remember, you just need to show that you are a diligent worker. The story does not matter, your definition of going above and beyond does. Pick a story and rehearse it until you can deliver with confidence. This will ensure that you leave a lasting impression and show you are qualified for the position.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CUSTOMER OR MANAGEMENT ORIENTED?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus on the type of position you are applying for&hellip; &ldquo;No, kidding!&rdquo; I say that because this will determine what type of scenario you describe. If you are applying for a position that deals with customers, describe your success with assisting customers. If you are an associate reporting to a manager, describe positive impressions you have had with past managers. Relating your answers to the job description will display focus and preparation skills to the hiring manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAMPLE ANSWER</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While working with my last company as a sales representative, I had a meeting with a potential client.

This question can bring you down a slippery slope if you don&rsquo;t answer it correctly. For the most part, this question is straightforward. Your potential employer wants to know whether or not you have any goals or motivation to continue learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Learning + Education Does Not Always = Coursework</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be so narrow-minded to think that furthering your education only applies to college coursework. If you have absolutely no intention of going back to school, then make that clear! That&rsquo;s totally O.K. What&rsquo;s not O.K. is having no motivation to continue learning. If your goals can be achieved by working hard and learning from your managers, then make sure to let your interviewer know that. Being coachable, and not claiming to be a &ldquo;know it all&rdquo; will take you a long way in an interview. <strong>Quick Tip</strong>: I recommend saying that you are always eager to learn and grow. Mention how you love to read self-development books, watch educational YouTube videos, etc. Proving that you are not idle or dependent on someone else for your education will surely impress your interviewer.

Or Is it?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do plan to go back to school, that&rsquo;s great! Many online resources recommend always being transparent with your goals to continue education. But we know better. Although this CAN help you, it is important to make it very clear that going back to school will not affect your ability to do your job. Also, you need to make sure that whatever it is you are going back to school for, is relevant to the development of your career. If you are applying for a sales position, but want to go back to school for an engineering degree, it paints a pretty clear picture that you don&rsquo;t intend to work in sales long-term. Depending on the position you are applying for and how much commitment they will require, it would be wise to adjust your answer. If you secretly want to become an engineer, I would not tell your sales interviewer. Some people tell you to go into the interview and be 100% honest. Give it a try and let me know how that is working out for you.

Just put yourself in the interviewer&rsquo;s shoes. Do you want to hire somebody who has no aspirations to better themselves? Do you want to hire somebody who is passionate about a completely different job? Or would you rather hire someone who has long-term goals to learn and grow in the job you are hiring for?

The honeymoon period is over, and the job you once loved has now become dull and boring. Getting yourself to go to work now requires summoning all of your energy and strength. Or maybe you never liked your job to begin with. Whatever the case, you now find that it takes everything you have just to get yourself to work every day. Countless people find themselves in this situation at some point in their careers. However, just because this attitude may be common and even normal, doesn&rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t attempt to combat it. To help you in your quest to love your job, I have a few motivational techniques that may help get you started. There are both mental and behavioral changes that you can make in order to change your feelings about your job, and each has both primary and secondary benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Mental Changes:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <strong>Being grateful that you have a job</strong>. Although the unemployment rate has improved, there are still a great many people who are unemployed or underemployed. Be grateful that you&rsquo;re not one of them, and that you have a job to go to everyday. Having an attitude of gratitude will not only help you love your job more but will give you an overall more positive perspective on your day. Consider it a secondary benefit of grateful thinking. 2. <strong>Being grateful that you can do your job</strong>. Continuing with the theme of gratitude, there are so many people that don&rsquo;t have either the cognitive or physical capacity to do your job. Be grateful for the ability that you possess, and that you are able to successfully do your job. A secondary benefit to this type of thinking is increased self-esteem. Are you starting to see how one good thing leads to other good things? 3. <strong>Think of all the benefits that will come from doing your job</strong>. Do you get to help people? Do you get to help improve processes and how things are done? Whatever it is that you do, do your best at it and feel the feeling of a job well done. A secondary benefit of this is having a greater feeling of purpose in your life. If nothing is working, maybe it&#39;s time for a new job. Check out the<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/best-tips-for-a-mid-career-change/\">Best Tips For A Mid-Career Change.</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Behavioral Changes:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>4. <strong>Use a pre-work routine to get motivated.</strong> Maybe that means quietly sipping coffee while reading the morning paper. Or maybe it means dancing to your favorite music while you get ready for work. Whatever it is, find a routine that preps you for your day. The primary benefit is that it helps you start your day in a positive way, and the secondary benefit is that it adds more fun to your life. 5. <strong>Use the reward system.</strong> When all else fails, use the reward system. Did you contribute new ideas at every meeting this week? Buy yourself a new DVD. Did you turn in your long and complicated report on time? Go get a massage. You get the idea. The primary benefit of the reward system is that simple good feeling that comes from getting a treat/reward. The secondary benefit is that it increases the likelihood that you will do that good behavior again in the future. Regardless of whether you choose mental changes and/or behavioral changes, these approaches should help put some pep in your step as you head out the door for work. Give it a try and notice the changes that occur.</p>','Stephanie-Swanbeck.jpg','2017-01-24 16:49:44','how-to-regain-motivation-in-the-workplace','How To Regain Motivation In The Workplace | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(100,1,'What Is Your Greatest Failure, And What Did You Learn From It?','A common behavioral interview question that people struggle with answering is, What is your greatest failure?

Some of the trickiest questions seem to be the ones that ask you to explain something negative about yourself. Similar questions that you might be asked include, <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-are-your-weaknesses/\"><strong>What are your weaknesses</strong></a> or <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/tell-me-about-a-time-you-did-something-wrong-how-did-you-handle-it\">Tell me about a time you did something wrong.</a></strong>&nbsp;When you are interviewing, the last thing you want to do is have the hiring manager think you are a bad person. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to take a few minutes before your interview to prepare answers to these questions. The trick here isn&rsquo;t to avoid answering the question and state that you have never failed. The reason the hiring manager is asking you this question is to determine if you can handle failure, learn from your mistakes, and become a better person afterward. Think of an example to use in an interviewer that can accomplish these points, and you will do great! I am going to break down 3 simple steps for answering this question. Each step will build upon the other until you have the perfect combination for addressing failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Can you handle failure?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to handle failure is crucial to any successful person. There isn&rsquo;t a single human being who is successful at something who didn&rsquo;t first fail. Being confident and being able to accept your failure is key. Don&rsquo;t get defensive or blame somebody else for this failure. Own up, and take responsibility for your actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Do you learn from your mistakes?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy for someone to admit that they have failed. Especially if it&rsquo;s a very obvious failure that you can&rsquo;t blame anyone else for. But, it takes a truly great person to actually learn and grow from their mistakes. Don&rsquo;t just acknowledge your failure, figure out what the cause of the failure was, and determine a solution to prevent it from happening again. Showing your interviewer that you take the time to analyze your mistakes and improve upon them is going to speak highly toward your character.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Are you a better person?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The third step is to become a better person. It&rsquo;s a great start to admit that you have failed. And it&rsquo;s even better when you take the time to think about these mistakes and improve upon them. But, the absolute best case scenario is when you become a better person from these mistakes. This happens when you finally change your mindset from thinking of failure as a negative, and you turn it into a positive. Thomas A. Edison says &ldquo;I have not failed. I&#39;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#39;t work.&rdquo; What an amazing perspective towards failure!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Answer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in college, I worked at a solar company as a door-to-door outside sales person. I was constantly thinking of new ways to bring in business, outside of knocking on doors. I developed a PowerPoint presentation and walked around to local businesses sharing the idea of a partnership. The way it worked was, I planned to leave business cards with a special promo code at each partner store. If anyone called me for a free solar consultation and referred to the business card, we would provide that person with a $20 voucher towards that store/restaurant. This becomes a win-win-win. The customer gets $20. The business gets $20. And I received my solar consultation. Although the logistics sounded good, and I even received a few stores who were interested in partnering with me, I did not run the idea past my company first. They told me that they were unwilling to provide the $20 voucher towards the solar appointment and that it wouldn&rsquo;t work. I quickly learned that even great ideas can be turned down, and there was absolutely nothing that I could do about it. In the future, I will confirm with my company that this would be O.K. before trying to create a plan of my own.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>P.S.

Another “Walk in the Park” question… but be prepared to sell yourself when the hiring manager says, Tell me about your educational background!','<p>Awesome! Another &ldquo;Walk in the Park&rdquo; question&hellip; This should never be your mindset when interviewing with a new company. It&#39;s great to be confident, but be prepared to sell yourself when the hiring manager says, Tell me about your educational background! This question provides a great opportunity to relate your coursework with the required tasks of the position. To land a job offer, you are expected to make every response relevant. This is obviously easier said than done, but follow the below guidelines to navigate this question.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s On My Resume&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The interviewer has looked over your resume and likely glanced at your education section. Yet, most will state their degree and the school they attended. This is not how you separate yourself from other average candidates. Go into detail! Discuss coursework that has built your skill set in order to be successful in the open position. Having a few specific responses ready will help, as certain subjects will relate more to a given company. This is obviously for those who have more than one pending interview. Remember, your resume got you in the door, now it is up to you to close the deal! For another article related to education, see <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/why-did-you-choose-your-major\">Why Did You Choose Your Major?</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Underwater Basket-Weaving?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, your major aligns with your chosen industry. If this holds true, try and avoid standard classes you were forced to take. &ldquo;But those classes are important?!!!&rdquo; &hellip; Of course, they are, but your hiring manager is most likely aware of those. Try to discuss elective courses that you <em><strong>chose</strong> </em>to take. We are not saying discuss the softball class you participated in with your buddies. Choose the electives that were included in your major course work. If your degree does not relate to your career path, don&rsquo;t panic! You will just need to be more creative with your response. As long as you choose relevant skills you gained throughout your education, the above still relates to you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sample Answer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During my time at (School Name), I took many courses that have given me the skill set to be successful in this position. Being a Finance major, I found a passion for financial accounting. Although my coursework was mainly based on financial analysis, I chose accounting as one of my upper division electives. This course pushed me out of my comfort zone as most of my classmates were majoring in accounting. Since entering the finance industry, I feel I have used a majority of what I learned in that class.

But how do you know for sure? There are a few major signs that it&#39;s time for a LinkedIn profile makeover. In this article, we will lay out 5 simple checklist items that may indicate it is time for a LinkedIn makeover.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1- You have not achieved an &ldquo;All-Star&rdquo; profile strength</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the easiest things you can do to boost your LinkedIn presence is to achieve an &ldquo;all-star&rdquo; profile strength. There are 5 levels of LinkedIn profile strengths: (5) All-Star (4) Expert (3) Advanced (2) Intermediate (1) Beginner All you must do to achieve the &ldquo;All-Star&rdquo; rank is: (1) Add a profile photo (2) List 2+ positions you have held w/ descriptions (3) List 5+ skills on your profile (4) Write a summary (5) Fill out your industry &amp; zip code (6) Add your education (7) Have 50+ connections Hopefully, by now you have achieved &ldquo;All-Star&rdquo; status. But even though LinkedIn calls you an all-star, this is really just the beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2- You are job hunting and receiving no hits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are on the market looking to attract employers, then you better hope that your LinkedIn Profile is top notch. After receiving your resume, one of the first things that any recruiter/hiring manager will do is look at your social media accounts. Why would they do that!? Well, they want to make sure you are a real person, a good person, and confirm that what you listed on your resume is true. LinkedIn is the best place to go for this. A LinkedIn makeover is not only important to appear &ldquo;professional&rdquo; and &ldquo;truthful&rdquo;, but it also helps you get noticed. Believe it or not, a well-written fully optimized LinkedIn profile will help recruiters find you. Recruiters like to search for potential hires on LinkedIn. When they search, it&rsquo;s important that they can find you. If you don&rsquo;t have the right keywords on your resume to pop-up in their searches, then you will never be found. And if you are never found, well, it will be hard to get hired! Not sure where to start? Check out the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/19-essential-linkedin-profile-tips-for-job-seekers\">19 Essential LinkedIn Profile Tips For Job Seekers</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3- You have noticed a decrease in profile views</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, no! A decrease in profile views. Are you going out of fashion? Did you do something wrong? Have you been slacking on your posting game? Whatever it is, you are not alone! It&rsquo;s very common to have a ton of profile views one week, and very few the next week. This usually can be traced back to your level of activity. Have you been endorsing your connections? Have you been commenting on posts or publishing new articles? Are you continuing to add relevant connections to grow your network? Have you tried updating your headline? Changing your pic? Joining new groups? Doing these things will play a huge factor in the number of profile views that you receive. Quick Fix Tip: Did you accidentally check the little box on the right side of your profile making all your updates private? I only say this because sadly, it is very common! If you have tried these tips listed above, and you are still unhappy with the number of profile views you are receiving, it could very well be time for a <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/linkedin-profile-makeover\">LinkedIn Profile Makeover!</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4- You are not in the top 1% for profile views</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s human nature to want to be #1. Nobody joins a competition, race, or sporting event to come in&nbsp;last place. You don&rsquo;t take a test to score in the bottom 1 percentile. You don&rsquo;t strive for a salary within the lower 1% of Americans. LinkedIn drives some healthy competition (especially for a competitive spirited person such as myself) by showing you how you rank for profile views compared to the rest of your network. It can be very hard to become #1 (trust me I have been trying). But it isn&rsquo;t that hard to be in the top 1% of your connections. As a test, just for fun, I created a new LinkedIn profile to see how fast I could become a 1%er. Within 3 weeks I had over 2,000 connections and was ranked #14. Now, you don&rsquo;t have to be a math genius to know that is in the top 1%. I am not trying to brag; all I am trying to say is that this is totally do-able by anybody! If you aren&rsquo;t sure how to make this happen, it&rsquo;s probably time for a <a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/linkedin-profile-makeover/\"><strong>Professional LinkedIn Makeover</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5- You are reading this post &ndash; always can improve</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you are a complete boss, you might be thinking, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a LinkedIn makeover. I have an all-star profile strength, I receive job offers all the time, my profile views are steadily increasing, and I am in the top 1% of all my connections.&rdquo; Heck, you might even be #1 out of 20,000. If that is you, first I want to say, Congrats! You are awesome. But, I doubt you got your profile where it is today by being lazy and unambitious. So, I think it would be a fair assumption for me to say that you are highly competitive and driven. With that being said, why settle? Is #1 out of 20,000 good enough? Why not be #1 out of 50,000? I would be willing to bet that there is at least one thing on your profile that could improve. Whether you are a &ldquo;Beginner&rdquo; or an &ldquo;All-Star&rdquo;, a LinkedIn profile makeover could be highly beneficial.

It could be time for a professional resume makeover or cv writing service.','<p>Whether you have been job hunting for 1 week or 1 year, it&rsquo;s clear that the process is not fun. I have yet to meet somebody who wakes up in the morning and says &ldquo;I sure can&rsquo;t wait to apply for jobs today!&rdquo; All jokes aside, this is a serious matter. Finding a good job takes a lot of time and effort. Don&rsquo;t make the process harder on yourself by continuing to use a low-quality resume. But wait, how do you know if the problem is your resume? It could be so many other things! In this article, we are going to break down the 5 major signs it&rsquo;s time for a professional resume makeover. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/top-5-resume-sections-you-cant-go-without\"><u>Top 5 Resume Sections You Can&#39;t Go Without</u></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1) You have been using the same resume format for years</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you belong to that rare group of individuals who has kept the same job for over 5 years then it&#39;s probably time for a resume makeover. Believe it or not, a lot can change in 5 years. Just like you have grown in your career, the resume is forever changing. As an old wave of hiring managers reach retirement, a new generation is taking over. Some say this is a &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; generation, and other say an &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; generation. Whatever your opinion is, doesn&rsquo;t change the facts. The facts are that resumes go out of style faster than your cell phone. If you are not staying up to date with the latest resume trends, it will be a lot harder to find a job. It&rsquo;s not even so much that your resume style or formatting is out of date, it&rsquo;s more about the content. Companies are constantly changing the names and responsibilities of positions. It would behoove you to adjust the wording in your resume by comparing it with the open jobs you are interested in. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/professional-resume-style-headers-fonts-and-themes\">Professional Resume Style - Headers, Fonts, &amp; Themes</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2) You have a 3+ page resume</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoa, a 3-page resume. Really? Any resume over 2 pages is a little excessive. I don&rsquo;t care how senior you are. Yea, yea, it must just be my &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; millennial mindset. But I sure don&rsquo;t want to read a 5-page resume. And I am one of the few people I know that enjoys reading! You might as well stop reading this article, and start working on your resume makeover. Whether you do it yourself or use a professional cv writing service makes no difference. Just get it done. It&rsquo;s important to remember that your resume isn&rsquo;t designed to appeal to you, it&rsquo;s for the employer. Stop thinking about what you want to see, and put yourself in the shoes of the employer. If I see a 3+ page resume I am crumpling it into a ball, and reading 3 1-page resumes in the same amount of time. I call that being &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;. Again, whether you agree with this or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I am just trying to give you some perspective on what recruiters/hiring managers are doing. I am not saying this is the right way to do things, but when you receive 250 applicants for the same position, there must be some sort of elimination process. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-professional-resume\">How To Write A Professional Resume</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3) You are receiving rejection emails within days of applying</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion, this is the worst! You spend all this time applying for a job only to receive an automated rejection email within days. Sometimes hours.What nerve these companies have! Did they even read your resume? Do you really want to know the answer? The answer is, &ldquo;probably not&rdquo;. &ldquo;So you are telling me I spent an hour filling out their application and they didn&rsquo;t even look over it?&rdquo; Sadly, yes. Most of the time when you are receiving a response within days or hours it is sent from an ATS (Applicant Tracking System). This software scans your application, determines whether you are a good fit, and spits back out a yes, or in your case, a NO. Why are you receiving a no? And what can you do to fix it? Great questions! This is where cv writing services come in handy. Staying up to date with the latest resume trends, keywords, buzzwords, and applicant tracking systems is a full-time job in itself. It is extremely important to optimize your resume in every way possible towards the specific job and industry you are applying for. A resume makeover is attainable on your own, but is this something you want to try to do yourself? After all, it is your future job and well-being. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For Jobs</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4) You are changing industries or positions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are changing industries or trying to move into a completely different position, you might be in for a rough ride. With companies becoming more and more particular about the people they hire (due to high competition), it&rsquo;s hard to find a job unless you are the &ldquo;perfect fit&rdquo;. The best thing you can do in this situation is think of any and all ways that your previous experience could relate to the new. Don&rsquo;t expect that your salary should stay the same either. Often, companies are looking for relevant industry experience. This is why they pay what they do. If you are stepping into something new, it would be silly to expect the same pay. As amazing as your old resume might be, there is no doubt that you will need a resume makeover before applying to completely new positions. Again, you can definitely do this yourself, but if you don&rsquo;t want to, there are about 1,000 professional resume makeover services out there who would be more than happy to help. Finding a professional who has resume writing experience in the specific industry you are looking to get into could be a huge help. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/4-tips-to-write-your-resume-work-experience-section\">4 Tips to Write Your Resume Work Experience Section</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5) You have applied to hundreds of jobs with little to no response</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have applied to hundreds of jobs with little to no response, don&rsquo;t be discouraged. This is a great sign! Here&rsquo;s what we know. They have not given you a fair chance to know if you are a good fit for the position. In other words, it&rsquo;s not you who isn&rsquo;t getting the job. It&rsquo;s your resume! This is a lot better than having no idea why you aren&rsquo;t getting hired and feeling discouraged. If they have never even spoken with you, it&rsquo;s clear that your resume is in serious need of a makeover. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/what-to-include-in-a-resume-16-best-things\">What To Include In A Resume - 16 Best Things</a></strong> The resume is half the battle.

You can be the best interviewer in the world but if you don&rsquo;t get any interviews, what good will that do you?

You can find 100 articles online about resumes, all telling you to do completely different things. So how do you know who is right and who is wrong?\r\n\r\nI have always been told, “listen to those who have fruit on the tree”. Everyone has an opinion, but how many have put their opinion into action and seen great results because of it? So many writers/bloggers have never spent a day as a recruiter or hiring manager. So how would they know what to include in a resume? In this article, the experts at Find My Profession will break down 7 simple mistakes to avoid during a resume makeover.\r\n<h2>Resume Mistake #1 - Ditch The Objective</h2>\r\nJust about every resume expert agrees that you should replace an objective with a professional summary. The truth is, most employers only care about what you can do for them. Stating your personal goals and what YOU expect to get out of a position is frankly, pointless.\r\n\r\nReplacing an objective with a professional summary is an essential part of a resume makeover. This will help you express your applicable skills to the hiring manager with 3 to 4 solid sentences. This is important because the employer briefly scans your resume with an emphasis on your summary and skills sections. To learn how to structure a professional summary, see our article <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-great-resume-summary-statement\">How To Write A Great Resume Summary Statement.</a></strong>\r\n<h2>Resume Mistake #2 –Irrelevant Job Experience, Irrelevant Resume</h2>\r\nYour career is a very personal and hopefully rewarding journey! It is easy to throw ALL of your accomplishments on your resume because of pride. If some of those accomplishments do not align with the position you are applying for, you should remove them. This may be tough, but you need to use your resume real estate effectively.\r\n\r\nRegarding past work experience, don’t include more than 15 years of work history. This is a standard rule of thumb to go by. This should go without saying, but include only relevant experience. Also, avoid excessive bullet points for each position you list on your resume. Stick to 4-6 strategic points that express the required skills for the position you are applying for.\r\n\r\nNeed help on your work experience section? See <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/4-tips-to-write-your-resume-work-experience-section\">4 Tips To Write Your Resume Work Experience Section!</a></strong>\r\n<h2>Resume Mistake #3 – Personal Life – Keep It Professional</h2>\r\nI stated above that creating a resume (and the whole job searching process) is very personal. That does not mean that you should detail every aspect of your life. Again, if it does not relate to the open position, leave it out. This would include your hobbies, religion, and even your home life. Of course, these are great things that make you the person you are, but keep it professional. You can also consider your salary history as personal information that you should not include.\r\n\r\nVolunteer experience is different than your personal life and can look great on a resume. This is especially applicable to those who do not have as much relevant work experience.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-a-professional-resume\">How To Write A Professional Resume</a></strong>\r\n<h2>Resume Mistake #4 – Ridiculous Fonts &amp; Styling</h2>\r\nUnless you are applying for a design type position, don’t try and get fancy! You will not impress the employer with your ability to choose a cool font or color. They are looking for what you can bring to the table and a certain font will not show that.\r\n\r\nMake sure you do not throw any header, footer, or tables in the mix. Your resume will most likely be read by a robot first… Annoying, I know! The Applicant Tracking System can be thrown off by tables or headers. This would mean your resume is thrown away before a human can even review it. Using resume makeover services can eliminate that from happening.\r\n\r\nMaybe you don’t agree with this, so let me provide some additional logic. Each employer spends an average of 6 seconds reviewing a resume. Using an uncommon font/color can be a distraction for the employer causing them to read less in that 6 seconds then they would with a common font/color. Your goal is to make it easy for the employer to scan your resume. That way, they can quickly find whatever it is they are looking for.\r\n\r\nLearn more: <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/professional-resume-style-headers-fonts-and-themes\">Professional Resume Style - Headers, Fonts, &amp; Themes</a></strong>\r\n<h2>Resume Mistake #5–References &amp; Sloppy Contact Info</h2>\r\nMany people are told that references are important to include on your resume. I am here to assure you that this is a huge resume mistake. If you are asked to provide references either by a person or on your job application, then provide them. But leave them off your resume! I have personally worked at a staffing agency that would ask their recruiters to prowl job boards in search of references. Once we found references, we would call the hiring managers listed and try to solicit new business with them. Do your references a favor and leave them off your resume!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-write-an-amazing-cover-letter-with-examples/\"><strong>How To Write An Amazing Cover Letter With Examples</strong></a>\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you have a professional email when you add your contact info to your resume. Creating a resume is pointless if you have an email like sassypantsmcgee@whocares.com! While you’re at it, you can leave off your exact mailing address. City, State, and Street are fine, but it is not like the employer will send you a handwritten letter. Anybody has access to resumes on public job boards. If the application asks for your exact address, that’s fine! Do yourself a favor and keep the address off your resume!\r\n<h2>Resume Mistake #6 – Exorbitant Words</h2>\r\nHuh? That’s what I thought… Make sure that your resume is readable by the average Joe. You may be highly knowledgeable in your trade, but the recruiter may not have the same experience. Also, don’t try to make yourself sound smarter than you are. This can come back to bite you if you are called in for an interview.\r\n\r\nMake sure you spell out abbreviations such as B.S. (Bachelor of Science), or CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Administrator). This will be highly beneficial for two reasons.\r\n\r\n1. It helps the average recruiter know what you are talking about.\r\n2. It will help you get through applicant tracking systems by using all the right keywords.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of keywords, check out <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For Jobs.</a></strong>\r\n<h2>Resume Mistake #7 – Cut Out That Second Page</h2>\r\nUnless you are applying for a senior/executive position, keep your resume to one page. This is a huge resume mistake that is often overlooked. Because you only have 6 seconds, hiring managers don’t have time to read multiple pages. If you are having trouble trimming your resume down to one page, it might be time for a professional resume makeover.Your job search will be much more effective with a purposeful and concise resume tailored towards your desired job.\r\n\r\nNot sure if you need a <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/linkedin-profile-makeover/\">professional resume makeover?</a></strong> Find out by reading the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/5-major-signs-its-time-for-a-professional-resume-makeover\">5 Major Signs It’s Time For A Professional Resume Makeover.</a></strong>\r\n<h2>So What Do I Put On My Resume</h2>\r\nLuckily for you, we wrote a whole article on the essentials to include during your resume makeover.

People are set to be impressed within the first few seconds they see something great (or not) about you! This does not only happen in the regular meet and greet events or by chance at a mall or market. This also occurs when talking to clients/customers, interviewers, employers, and even on first dates.\r\n\r\nExperts say that the first few seconds are critical because you either leave a lasting “good” impression or “bad” impression. It is then ideal to be your best at all times especially when connecting with someone for the first time. It is critical if that ‘someone’ is going to be a business partner. You need to build the trust at first sight.\r\n<h2>How should you approach this?</h2>\r\nApproach this as a positive opportunity to close a deal, make a new friend, or be known as a person worth getting to know more. One important place to make a great first impression is during an interview. Check out the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/50-top-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">50 Top Job Interview Questions And Answers.</a></strong>\r\n<h2>Physical appearance matters</h2>\r\nPeople will like you at first if you look presentable. Be sure you are representing the image that speaks to you in the way you dress or do your hair. Putting your best self forward at all times will save you the dilemma of having to worry when you meet someone important. Confidence is crucial in making that great first impression.\r\n\r\nWith proper grooming and dressing up or dressing down, you can make a good first impression even before you speak. It will definitely make you feel ready.\r\n<h2>Proper approach and manner</h2>\r\nThis is one thing to know, and it is imperative. You must learn how to approach someone when they are talking to another person. The proper use of your body language plays a crucial part in making great impressions. It starts with approaching someone with a confident smile and a “Hi” or “Hello”. This will set the right disposition. Once your desired nature is acquired, the getting-to-know-you part will come naturally.\r\n\r\nUsing body language is good, but do not overdo any of it. If you tend to fidget when having a conversation with someone, calm yourself down and minimize your movements – usually, it’s the hand gestures that give you away. By crossing your arms or letting them rest on your lap, you can easily manage your nervousness.\r\n\r\nDo you have a tendency of swaying your arms so wide when you feel nervous? Then it would help to keep them folded but not in an intimidating manner. Another thing is finger&amp; lip biting. Some people who get nervous or impatient tend to bit their nails or inside of their lips unconsciously. If you have that tendency, practice not to do that! It does not only look embarrassing, but it looks childish.\r\n\r\nTaking a few deep breaths when you feel impatient or nervous can help a lot too. Breathing air in through your nostrils brings oxygen to your body, thus, helping your brain to think clearly.\r\n\r\nAbove all, make it your goal to develop your conversational skills. This is one great way of making a great first impression.','Nader-Mowlaee-Blog.jpg','2017-02-06 03:40:36','how-to-make-a-great-first-impression','How To Make A Great First Impression | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(106,1,'Resume Formats: One Size Does Not Fit All','Did you know that you might be using the wrong resume format? There are many different resume formats and each one should be designed specifically for your','Resumes are commonly thought to be something that must follow a certain cookie-cutter formula. In reality, your resume format is your ticket to an interview and must fit your individual situation like a glove.\r\n<h2>Technical/IT Experience</h2>\r\nA “standard” resume format typically includes a section at the bottom for skills. If you work in a technical/IT field, you need this section right at the top! A good place for this would be between your professional summary and your work experience. Break it down into sections such as:\r\n\r\n• Operating Systems: Windows, Linux\r\n• Software: CAD, AutoCAD, Dynascape\r\n• Languages: C+, C++\r\n• Security: Norton, McAfee\r\n\r\nAlso, creating a mini-version of this at the end of every employment section on your resume. This would show which of the things you listed at the top of your resume were used at each company, so the reader can get a feel for what kind of experience you have and how long you have used a program.\r\n<h2>Skilled Trade Experience</h2>\r\nA “standard” resume format typically does not include a section for equipment or tools that you have experience with. You owe it to yourself to create one – right at the top – in a similar format as the example shown above!\r\n\r\nWhere appropriate, you can do the mini-version after each position on your resume as well - also shown above.\r\n<h2>Perceived Instability</h2>\r\nMany books on resume formats and job searches will tell you to put your resume in the “functional” format instead of the “chronological” format when you have had a lot of gaps in employment for example. This is usually not the best strategy because companies may require your resume to be in chronological order as it is the easiest for them to decipher. In some cases, a functional resume format may be skipped altogether if it is too difficult to read. Ways to work around this include:\r\n\r\n• Use years only for the date ranges spent at each employer – do not add months.\r\n\r\n• If you have done a lot of contract work with the same contract agency, you can group your assignments under this common employer and only provide a date range for the employer and not each assignment.\r\n\r\nYou may also include the reason you left each position, if favorable, such as:\r\n\r\n• Company-wide restructuring\r\n\r\n• Layoff\r\n\r\n• Merger\r\n\r\n• Relocation for partner’s career\r\n<h2>Job Title Does Not Match experience</h2>\r\nIf your job title is “administrative assistant” but your experience goes well beyond what you would consider typical for that title, there are a couple of things you can do to slow the reader down and not have them glance over this position.\r\n\r\nWhile you cannot get very creative for your title because you need it to reasonably match what is seen from a background check during the hiring processes, you can put some specifics after the title:\r\n\r\n• Administrative Assistant (Sales &amp; Marketing)\r\n• Administrative Assistant – Sales/Marketing\r\n\r\nYou can also bunch activities/responsibilities/duties together and give them headers, perhaps in bold to make them stand out, instead of just listing them and put the most relevant ones at the top.\r\n\r\n• Administrative Assistant\r\n• Sales\r\n• Marketing\r\n• Administration\r\n• Calendar management\r\n• Meeting coordination\r\n• Expense reports\r\n<h2>Age</h2>\r\nOf course, hiring activities should not discriminate against more mature candidates, but it can happen, even subconsciously and there is no need to feed the flame.\r\n\r\nWon’t they see how old I am in an interview, you ask? Yes, but remember the purpose of the resume is to get you an interview. Once you are in front of them at an interview, you have a chance to sell yourself a lot better than simply on paper, with both your maturity and your fresh ideas.\r\n\r\nTo avoid giving away clues to your age, remember to go against what you read in resume writing books and:\r\n\r\n• Do not list the year you graduated in the education section of your resume.\r\n\r\n• Only list the past ten years of your work history under “Work Experience” unless the position is extremely relevant.\r\n<h2>No Work Experience</h2>\r\nJust about everybody at one point or another has been frustrated with the conundrum of not getting selected for an entry level position because you lack experience and how can you get experience if no one will hire you because you do not have experience?\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of techniques to use to give yourself the upper hand:\r\n\r\n• List relevant coursework at the top in a similar fashion as described above for IT and skilled trade professionals.\r\n\r\n• Don’t be afraid to list on-campus positions you have held such as RA, Cafeteria Cashier, etc. recruiters want to see that you are reliable and dependable even if your work experience is not particularly relevant.\r\n\r\nCreate a Volunteer Experience section on your resume and include:\r\n\r\n• Relevant experience\r\n\r\n• Any experience where you can showcase significant accomplishments\r\n\r\nHaving a custom <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/resume-makeover/\">resume</a></strong> format, not just to you, but to the position you are applying for is one of the most important parts of your job search. <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/coaching-services/interview-training/\">Interview training</a></strong> should take a close second.','Emily-Rosenzweig.jpg','2017-02-06 18:01:21','resume-formats-one-size-does-not-fit-all','Resume Formats: One Size Does Not Fit All | Find My Profession','','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(107,1,'The Art of Forming a New, Positive Habit','Before we get into how to form a new, positive habit, it\'s important to evaluate how happy your current habits make you.','<p>Forming new habits, whether good or bad, change our lives and point us in a new direction. Today, you are basically the sum of the habits you have created. If you wake up at noon, play video games all day and go to bed at 4am, you&#39;re the sum of those habits. Before we get into how to form a new, positive habit, it&#39;s important to evaluate how happy your current habits make you. Most of us don&#39;t do a proper self-evaluation and only vow to change our habits when a new year is coming. However, those changes usually last about a week, maybe two, and you&#39;re right back to your old habits. Habits are not easy to form or change. Even adjusting a current habit can take time to really stick. You may slip, but as long as you don&#39;t fall and stay down, you can form any new habit you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Understanding Why You Want to Form the New Habit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Forming a new habit starts with an understanding of why. If you don&#39;t know why you want to make the habit a part of your life, you&#39;ll likely give up before you even get close to forming it. Define the &quot;why&quot; before you start trying to create your new, positive habit. For example, if you decide you want to start waking up at 7am instead of noon, why do you want to wake up so much earlier? Maybe you want to get up earlier so you can enjoy more of the sunlight of the day or because you landed a new job requiring you to clock in at 9am. It doesn&#39;t so much matter what the reason is, but it does matter that you define the reason. Without a solid reason for waking up at 7am instead of noon, your success with this new habit will likely be short-lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Creating a Trigger</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Habits often have a trigger. In a very simple form, the habit of looking at your phone after it makes noise, lights up or vibrates, is a habit in most people&#39;s lives. The trigger is the noise, light or motion of the phone. Once you hear, see or feel it, you automatically look at your phone to see if someone is calling, you have a text message or there is some other type of notification you should handle immediately. With any habit, it&#39;s not much different. There&#39;s a trigger that causes you to behave in a certain way. New habits need a trigger to help them stick. After you have defined the &quot;why&quot; you need to create a trigger. Building on the example above, if you want to wake up at 7am instead of noon, maybe your trigger is an alarm clock. Then, you turn on your light and get out of bed. While the alarm clock may be your initial trigger, turning on your light and getting out of bed may become the trigger that helps the habit stick.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Define the Benefits/Rewards</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with defining the &quot;why&quot; of the new habit you want to form, it&#39;s important to define the benefits/rewards you will gain from the new habit. If you want to wake up earlier, maybe the benefits will be more productivity, peaceful time before the world becomes busy or the beauty of starting your day watching the sunrise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making Your New Habit Stick</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&#39;s a great start to define the &quot;why&quot;, create a trigger and figure out the benefits/rewards you will gain from the new habit, this still isn&#39;t enough to make it stick, in most cases. Here are a few tips to help you make your new habit stick and become a real habit. Track your Progress Whether you use a downloadable app or a simple calendar with a marker, you should track your progress. Mark each day you are successful and don&#39;t mark days you are not successful with your new habit. This will help you to see the chain forming of days, which can be very motivating. Once you reach 21 days in a row, you&#39;ll have started to form the new habit. Get to 66 days and it should start to become something you just do without thinking about it much.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>One Habit at a Time</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of why most people fail when it comes to New Year&#39;s Resolutions is they try to take on too much. They want to lose weight, read more books, spend more time with family and make more money. When they take all of this on, it&#39;s likely none will stick. Instead of trying to take on 10 habits at once, concentrate on just one. Once you&#39;ve made waking up at 7am a habit instead of getting up at noon, you can start working on the next habit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Don&#39;t Give Up After One Failure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;re likely to fail at least a few times when forming a new habit. There will be a day that breaks your chain of days and causes you to wonder if you should even keep trying to form this new habit. Don&#39;t give up just because you have a bad day. Remember, you&#39;re human and you&#39;re not perfect. Pick yourself back up and move on to the next day. When you use these tips, combine with understanding the &quot;why&quot;, creating a trigger and defining the benefits/rewards, you&#39;re more likely to form that new, positive habit.</p>','The-Art-of-Forming-a-New-Positive-Habit.jpg','2017-02-06 18:29:58','the-art-of-forming-a-new-positive-habit','The Art Of Forming A New Positive Habit | Find My Profession',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'Publish'),(108,1,'7 Simple Mistakes To Avoid During a LinkedIn Profile Makeover','Many people do not take advantage of all the LinekdIn features. Be aware aware of these 7 simple mistakes to avoid during a LinkedIn profile makeover...','<p>Social Media has changed the world. Whether you like it or not, it appears that it is here to stay! Although LinkedIn has been around for years, many people do not take advantage of all the features at their disposal. Make sure you are aware of these 7 simple mistakes to avoid during a LinkedIn profile makeover.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mistake #1 &ndash; Pose For The Camera!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of your thoughts, it is very important to have a profile photo. You do not need to go out and get professional headshots taken (although, I am not judging those that do). A person is much more likely to pass up your profile if you do not have a picture. If this is you, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; I was that guy once too! Have someone snap a headshot (above the shoulders) of you, it is that simple.&nbsp;See <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/5-tips-for-a-perfect-linkedin-profile-photo\">5 Tips For A Perfect LinkedIn Profile Photo</a></strong> for more details about adding a profile photo for your LinkedIn profile makeover! Whatever picture you choose, NO DUCK FACES!!! What is worse than no profile picture at all? An unprofessional photo&hellip; Trust me when I say that LinkedIn is different than the standard social media site. We will describe the difference a little later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mistake #2 &ndash; Can I Have Your Number?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was told growing up that you should not provide personal contact info on the internet. Well, if you are using LinkedIn during your job search, at least provide your email address. It&rsquo;s pretty tough for a recruiter to reach you if you don&rsquo;t provide your information. But what about the private message feature? That&rsquo;s great and all, but recruiters are limited to the number of InMails they can send. Make it easy for them and provide your contact info by adding your contact info to your LinkedIn profile makeover. While you&#39;re at it, customize your LinkedIn URL! This looks much better than the random series of numbers and letters you are given originally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mistake #3 &ndash; How&rsquo;s Your Headline?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to separate yourself from the average user on LinkedIn. Your headline is one of the first things that someone will see if your profile comes up in a search. You must be strategic in choosing the appropriate headline for your LinkedIn profile makeover. Be careful what you read because I see more bad headlines than good. Examples: <strong>Worst:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Desktop Support Technician at Stuff &amp; Junk&rdquo; <strong>O.K.:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Desktop Support Technician in Market Leader in Retail.&rdquo; <strong>Best:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Desktop Support Technician in Market Leader in Retail. Gadget Enthusiast.&rdquo; For more on LinkedIn Headlines, check out&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/linkedin-headline-ideas-that-dont-suck/\">LinkedIn Headline Ideas That Don&rsquo;t Suck!</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mistake #4 &ndash; Don&rsquo;t Forget The Keywords!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have read anything about a resume makeover, you know that keywords are too important to ignore. Your LinkedIn profile is a lot like your resume in many ways. So check out&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"/career-advice/how-to-use-resume-keywords-when-applying-for-jobs\">How To Use Resume Keywords When Applying For Jobs</a>&nbsp;</strong>and apply these lessons to your LinekdIn profile makeover. For recruiters to find you, they search certain keywords commonly used in a given industry. For them to click on your profile, you need those words! I am assuming you get the picture. If you are struggling to find keywords for your line of work, a simple google search will show you the way. These keywords will bring recruiters straight to your profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mistake #5 &ndash; Is Your Summary Off Track?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For some reason, someone made it cool to write your resume summary in the third person&hellip; Lame, I know! Luckily for you, your LinkedIn Profile Summary can be in the first person. This is your chance to brag a little so don&rsquo;t be afraid to list your accomplishments! Stick to 3-5 paragraphs of your most relevant and flattering career experience. As stated before, your LinkedIn should mirror what is on your resume. Make sure your work experience lines up with what is on your resume. Don&rsquo;t make up positions that do not appear on your resume as you will be called out in an interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mistake #6 &ndash; Using LinkedIn Like Facebook</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This happens all the time, especially around the 2016 Presidential Election. There is a reason why LinkedIn is considered a PROFESSIONAL social media site. This is not the place to share the pictures of your weekend hangout with your buddies. Your LinkedIn profile should be used to grow your professional network in order to advance your career. On that note, be cautious of linking your LinkedIn profile with your other social media pages. Nothing will stop a recruiter in their tracks like a link to your profanity ridden Facebook page. I suggest limiting access to any pictures a hiring manager can judge you on. I promise your efforts will be rewarded in the long run!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mistake #7 &ndash; Non-Strategic Connections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that you should not add just anyone to your network on LinkedIn. But, I would rephrase that a bit to state you can add anyone who has connections in your industry. If you feel someone may be a valuable connection, add them! Some think that you should only add who you know personally, but networking is all about meeting new people. The worst a person can do is not add you back, but don&rsquo;t be a creeper and continue pursuing an individual. The first few hundred connections are very important! This is what determines who LinkedIn suggests for you to add. If you add a bunch of non-industry specific connections, that will do you no good.

Even more staggering is the fact that only 13% of employees LIKE going to work. Whether you hate your job or are on the fence, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the signs it&#39;s time to quit your job. Did you know that being overworked is the second most common reason people quit their jobs? The first reason is a <strong><a href=\"/career-advice/signs-its-time-to-quit-your-job-low-salary/\">low salary.</a></strong> Shockingly over 63% of people who quit their job claim that it was due to being overworked. We will show you how to determine whether you are being overworked, and more importantly, what potential solutions you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Are You Being Overworked?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, first of all, being overworked is pretty subjective. If you truly feel like you are being overworked, then who&rsquo;s to say you aren&rsquo;t? However, there is a difference between being in a highly demanding job (something you sign up for) and being overworked (did not sign up for). If you are being compensated significantly for your hard work, then I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily call that being overworked. The Dictionary.com definition of Overwork is: &ldquo;to cause to work too hard, too much, or too long. Again, this is subjective. What is &ldquo;too much&rdquo; or &ldquo;too long&rdquo; for you might be completely different to someone else. Whatever the case is, if you are working too hard or too long and you no longer wish to do so, it&rsquo;s time you make some changes. Take some time to research a similar role to yours in other companies. Don&rsquo;t be shy. Feel free to send a message to some professionals within your LinkedIn network and see what their day to day is like. Is the amount of work you are putting in worth the amount of money you are being paid? Pull out your phone and click on the calculator app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Let&rsquo;s do some basic Algebra.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>How many hours do you work per week? Answer: <span style=\"color:#008000\"><strong>60</strong></span> How many weeks do you work per year? Answer: <span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>50</strong></span> What is your current salary? Answer: <span style=\"color:#ff6600\"><strong>$120,000</strong></span> What is your hourly rate? <strong><span style=\"color:#ff6600\">$120,000</span> / (<span style=\"color:#008000\">60</span>x<span style=\"color:#0000ff\">50</span>) </strong> Answer: <span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>$40</strong></span> Now, do you LOVE your job? Chances are, you don&rsquo;t. So, if you could easily find an opportunity paying $100,000/year but you were working 40 hours per week, don&rsquo;t you think that would be much better? Let&rsquo;s do some more Algebra. <strong><span style=\"color:#ff6600\">$100,000</span> (<span style=\"color:#008000\">40</span>x<span style=\"color:#0000ff\">50</span>) = <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">$50/hour</span></strong> Oddly enough, by decreasing your salary by $20,000 you were able to increase your hourly rate by 25%! Pretty cool, huh? So, I guess the decision is yours. Is overworking yourself worth the extra income? If not, then it&rsquo;s time to consider your exit strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overworking Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you determine that you are in fact being overworked, now it&rsquo;s time to do something about it. You don&rsquo;t have a ton of options here, but I will lay them out anyways.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>1. Speak with your manager.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, this can be a little scary if you don&rsquo;t have a great relationship with your manager. However, this is a great first place to start if you enjoy your current company and would like to stay on board. Share your concerns with your manager and let them know that you feel like you are being overworked. Prepare some valid points, and explain the benefits that you could bring if your workload was lightened.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Will your productivity improve if you are able to concentrate on fewer tasks?</li>\r\n	<li>Will you be able to focus longer? Give better speeches? Make better decisions?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Delegate more!</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are in the position to delegate tasks, then take advantage. I am not saying to take advantage of your employees, but maybe you need to be more trusting with tasks. Are you the type of person who likes to control every aspect of the job, even the things you could easily delegate? Are you doing this out of fear that your employees will not be able to perform properly? If so, that is the completely wrong mindset. Develop your employees properly and you won&rsquo;t have to worry about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>3. Find a new job.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked about this briefly above. Take some time to put your feelers out and see what kind of opportunities are out there. To be honest, there is almost always something better than what you currently have. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to look around. If it has been quite some time since you have had to look for a job, then hire a professional. Times change! Do you know that there is a company who will find and apply to jobs for you while you are working away in your office? They can even do it discretely so that your current company has no idea you are looking. The company is <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a></strong> and they have a 100% success rate at what they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>So, Should You Quit Your Job?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s up to you. If you are being overworked, then the answer is yes. This is not only unfair for you, but it is extremely harmful to your body. Is a higher paycheck but a lower hourly rate worth knocking a few years off your life? Probably not. If Solution 1 and 2 don&rsquo;t work for you, let the team at <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a></strong> help.

It’s important to be aware of the signs it\'s time to quit your job.','<p>According to a recent study by Gallup, only 13% of employees LIKE going to work. Even more staggering is the fact that 70% of employees HATE their jobs. Whether you hate your job or are on the fence, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the signs it&#39;s time to quit your job. Did you know that a low salary is the number one reason people quit their jobs? The number two reason is <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/signs-its-time-to-quit-your-job-being-overworked/\">being overworked.</a></strong> Shockingly over 69% of people who quit their job claim that it was due to a low salary. We will show you how to determine whether you are being underpaid, and more importantly, what potential solutions you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Are You Being Underpaid?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel like you are receiving a low salary, then you probably are. But hey, let&rsquo;s not jump to conclusions. Let&rsquo;s do some research. Go to <strong><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/\">Glassdoor.com</a></strong> and type in your job title, as well as the location that you are working. For example, when I type in Project Manager &ndash; San Francisco, I see that the average salary is $95,723 with a range from 67k &ndash; 132k. If I change the location to New York, I see that the average salary is $86,250 with a range from 44k &ndash; 143k. Depending on your level of experience, you can decide where you should fit. The first thing you should do if you determine you are underpaid is create a list of all the benefits you bring to the company. Compare this list with your salary, and write down a realistic dollar amount that you feel like each benefit is worth. Make this list realistic and use as many facts and figures as possible to back it up. After you create the list there are only three possible outcomes. 1. You realize that you are being underpaid for what you do. 2. You realize that you are being paid a fair wage for what you do. 3. Or, You realize that you are being overpaid for what you do. Most people are going to fall under category 1. If you fall under category 3, rip up the list, and never speak of it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Low Salary Solution</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ask For A Raise</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoy most aspects of your company and the salary is the only thing causing you grief, consider taking your list to your manager and asking for a raise. You are more likely to receive a raise if you can justify the increase in pay compared to someone who just walks in demanding a raise. If that doesn&rsquo;t&rsquo; work, or you are considering quitting for reasons other than your salary, you can consider a few alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relocate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can quit your job and move to a higher paying location. This is the riskiest approach because it involves a lot of time and effort. Moving is never easy, neither is finding a new home, making new connections, etc. (Consider all the costs associated with relocation and a potential increase in cost of living)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Switch Companies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can stay in the same location, but find a company that will offer you a higher salary. This is the ideal scenario for most people. Unless you are sick and tired of the city or state you live in, this is usually the smartest move. However, don&rsquo;t quit your job before you start looking. Make sure what you are looking for is achievable. Ideally, you will have a few offers on the table before putting in your 2 weeks. It&rsquo;s common knowledge that looking for a job can be a full-time job in itself. That&rsquo;s why <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a></strong> specializes in finding their clients (job seekers) the perfect job. Let us handle the search for you so you can keep working and bringing in a paycheck without any downtime in between careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Switch Industries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can change careers. Either select a higher paying industry or find a completely different job that offers the salary you are looking for. Check out our article on the <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/best-tips-for-a-mid-career-change/\">Best Tips For A Mid-Career Change.</a></strong> Switching industries can also be a big risk. But if you truly hate what you do, and not just your current job, making this switch will be worth it. (Consider whether your skills are transferable. Will you require additional schooling? Put your feelers out before quitting your long-term job)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So, Should You Quit Your Job?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No one can tell you what to do. This is a big decision and one that you will need to fully commit to. You can&rsquo;t halfway quit your job. If you are genuinely unhappy with your salary, and your company won&rsquo;t give you a raise, then I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s time to look elsewhere. If your company isn&rsquo;t loyal to you and your needs, then why are you bending over backward for them? Still unsure?

Yet self-care is essential to bring our most alert, confident, and relaxed self to the job search process.','<p>With endless job applications to complete, cover letters to write, along with networking on LinkedIn and other professional groups; the job search can take its toll. It&rsquo;s easy to forget to nurture ourselves in the frenzy of seeking employment. Yet self-care is essential so that we bring our most alert, confident, and relaxed self to the entire search process, especially the interviews. Moving to a new location and changing your scenery, even when done in short intervals, can take you out of a stuck place and renew your perspective. Pausing for some refreshment time will serve your job search well and bring you more peace. The following are some simple tips to help you set your project(s) aside and take a much-needed break.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Turn your cell phone OFF and&hellip;.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Enjoy lunch outside.&nbsp;</strong>Eat slowly and savor each bite. Take a few moments to listen to the call of the songbirds. Feel the breeze lift your spirits. Renew your energy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Take morning and afternoon breaks outdoors </strong>(five to ten minutes each) A few minutes to breathe in the fresh air and place the stale &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; on pause can renew your perspective and revitalize your spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Walk around the block for a fresh start.</strong> Find the closest park bench and sit still for a few moments. Be a keen observer of the people that pass by. What do you notice? &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re near a fountain or a quiet nook, pause at one of these refreshment centers to recharge. You&rsquo;ll feel&nbsp;alive when you return to your desk.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Go to the closest grassy area (or the beach if you live near one) and sit down</strong> on a towel or blanket that you bring along. Connect with the sacred earth. You may want to take your shoes off for a few moments to feel the grass (or sand) under your feet. If you feel comfortable doing so, close and rest your eyes for a while. Release any thoughts of your job search during this time. Focus instead on any nature sounds e.g., the birds, the wind.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Go to an outdoor caf&eacute;, a cozy restaurant or coffee house with &ldquo;character&rdquo; for your lunch break (ideally someplace new).</strong> Breathe out any pent up concerns from your job search and breathe in the new life within your change of scenery.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You deserve this time for rejuvenation. You&rsquo;ll likely feel more motivated to jump back into your job search when you return. Your creative expression and energized spirit will thank you.

Studying interview questions is great, but you need to get your mind in shape for an interview as well.','<p>I remember when in I was in middle school and had to write a book report on Rome, Italy. Full disclaimer: I was a horrible writer in middle school. I still did the book report, of course, but it wasn&#39;t as long as it could have been due to my lack of interest in writing. So I supplemented the book report by constructing a model of the Coliseum. To my surprise, it worked--my history teacher loved how I had thought outside of the box. That day, I learned a valuable lesson: things can be done out of context. That experience and many others launched my journey into thinking about what shapes our minds. They are our greatest asset, and they can be our nuclear bomb if we allow them. It would be bold to think that we can create our paths and how we can shape how we think but I believe we can. I mean, why not? We put a man on the moon! So heck yes, we can.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&#39;s O.K. To Dream</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I daydream about various things: personal and professional goals, acing a job interview, gardening, learning to cook... I think you get the point. What we believe in our heads tells us how to feel. How powerful are our minds? Do we believe what other people say if it&#39;s positive or negative? Do we listen? When we filter out the negativity, this is the mind being strong and telling us--subconsciously--to believe in ourselves. These are things we do without even thinking about it. Whether you are in the throes of holiday shopping or simply looking for great weekly deals on groceries, you&#39;re not that different from most people--myself included. I like finding nice sales and saving money. There is a satisfaction in finding a good deal while shopping. For some of us, shopping is a low-pressure event; we take our time to browse around to see what is on sale or seek out bargains as we window shop. We don&#39;t just rush out and buy the first items we see. Whether you&#39;re looking for jeans, shoes, or just a shirt you don&#39;t just browse one store--you go to several different stores to compare.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Focus On Your Actions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you a sports fanatic? I am. I was watching a Golden State Warriors game, and Klay Thompson was at the free-throw line. His free-throw technique looks effortless: he bounces the ball a few times, aims, and shoots the ball toward the basket. He releases the ball in the air, and with a slight flick of his wrist he follows through. The ball soars through the air, and all you hear is &quot;swish.&quot; Nothing but net! Thompson is calm and focused on every action of making a free-throw. Why? His head concentrates on all of his actions. So what do free-throws and shopping have in common? Anything that we do, we include our thoughts and minds. What can happen? A lot because the way we think can change things. If you think about it, our minds are our biggest sources of power. It is all in the mind how we approach things. Our minds can be our greatest roadblock or they can help us achieve what we need to move forward. In other words, our minds can be our biggest assets or our biggest weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Give Your Mind A Break</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people ask me the best way to achieve a healthy mind; honestly, it starts with you and how you treat your mind. First of all, identify the cause of stressors and how you can change your attitude around them. A good technique is to find a positive attribute around your biggest stressors. When I was in the sixth grade, I got in trouble because my mother asked me to come back a certain time from the mall, but I was late. I told my mom that my friend Gabby could stay out later and so we did. Well, that was the wrong answer. My mother told me that I knew better and that I needed to think for myself. I am sure your parents told you this same story. The technique I will be explaining will allow you to picture yourself in the future you want to have. Write it down and feel free to be very descriptive about it. This image will serve as a reminder that will be with you no matter where you go. It all about taking one step at a time to make your mind healthier and stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Baby Steps</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you find the &ldquo;positive,&rdquo; keep making small steps to achieve it. Each day it will transfer into something awesome. The shaping of your mind will continue to grow, and you will see the change in each moment. If you slip back into you old habits, don&#39;t worry--we all do it. Just continue to take steps forward and try again. Remember that one moment in life when you felt strong in spirit and mind--that is the moment you have to capture and keep. Keep that moment, feeling, sound, smell--remember everything about seizing that moment in time. That is the starting point for you to make your mind mentally strong and nothing will be able to break it. Hold that focus of what you want to do nothing can stop you now. No one on this earth can break you down no matter how hard they try. I have a little secret to share with you. Think of how you feel when you achieve something or are working hard to make something. When you put your mind to something, anything is possible. It is all about having that positive vision in your head that you can do it. Getting a new job, taking lessons to learn an instrument you&#39;ve always wanted to play, or simply taking steps to change old habits. Once you start to believe it will happen, things will start to change. Having a strong mind is the only way to make your goals come true. Go out and achieve positive outcomes!

Is multilevel marketing good? Bad? Or a Scam? We explain network & multi-level marketing from an unbiased perspective.','<h2>What Is Network Marketing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we are going to break down the facts and fictions behind network marketing with a detailed focus on multilevel marketing. First, let&rsquo;s get a basic understanding of what network marketing is. The most common form of networking marketing is multilevel marketing. Multilevel network marketing is a business model that consists of a network of distributors that are used to build the business. Network marketing is also referred to as multilevel marketing because the payouts occur at multiple levels. One of the main advantages of network marketing is that there are usually minuscule upfront investments to get started (around a few hundred dollars for a welcome kit and the ability to sell to others). To make money, most multilevel marketing companies will advise that you recruit other sales representatives. These recruits are called &ldquo;downline,&rdquo; and every sell they make generates income for those above them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is Network Marketing A Scam?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever asked yourself, is network marketing a scam? Believe it or not, that is a reasonable question to ask. Network marketing has been around for over one hundred years, and there are some companies out there that have given it a terrible reputation. Because of these companies, one of the most common questions asked when someone hears about network marketing is, is network marketing a scam? Network marketing is a legitimate business model that some people have been able to use to create a large amount of wealth. Just like any business model, there are going to be a few individuals who are very successful, and many others who are not as successful. Some other names you will hear people associate with network marketing is MLM, multilevel marketing, pyramid schemes, and much more. It is accurate to say that all pyramid schemes use a network marketing businesses model. However, it would not be accurate to say that every network marketing business is a pyramid scheme. In short, NO, network marketing is not a scam, but there are some scams out there to be aware of.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>A network marketing scam AKA &ldquo;a pyramid scheme.&rdquo;</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A network marketing scam and a pyramid scheme are the same things. They are both illegal. A network marketing scam is when a company tells you to pay for a membership without receiving any product or service in return. You are essentially just paying a chunk of money to be in a club/cult! There are additional criteria to deem a network marketing business an actual scam, but that is basically it. For the most part, pyramid schemes or network marketing scams are not around anymore. They are highly illegal, and there is a lot of regulation making sure companies like these do not exist. If a product or service is being offered, then it is most likely not illegal. Again, network marketing is not bad, but pyramid schemes or network marketing scams are! If you are unsure, check with the Federal Trade Commission for a more detailed explanation on whether your multilevel marketing company is legal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is Network Marketing Good?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody will have their opinion whether network marketing is good or bad. We took a survey and asked over 1000 current and former network marketing professionals, Is network marketing good? Our survey results showed that yes, network marketing, in general, is good. We found that most of the problems with network marketing were not problems with the business model, but difficulties with the company that was joined. Shockingly, 68% of people who quit a network marketing company, ended up joining another one within five years. This statistic shows us that it wasn&rsquo;t network marketing that was the problem, it was either the company or the people that caused negative experiences. A better question than &ldquo;is network marketing good&rdquo; would be to ask yourself if network marketing is right for you? There are many network marketing companies out there, so it is important to do your research on the one you decide to join before you commit to anything. You are off to a great start by reading this article! Trust me, the hour you will spend reading will be worth the thousands of dollars you save when joining a bad network marketing company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is Network Marketing Bad?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, network marketing is not bad. However, there are a lot of companies that have given network marketing a bad name. It is important to be careful when considering a network marketing company. Instead of asking yourself, is network marketing bad, you should do some research to determine if the network marketing company you are joining is bad, and what a better alternative would be. 1. You are going to want to make sure that you are in positive association. 2. Make sure there is a lucrative pay structure. If it takes a million people to make you a thousand dollars, then that is a pretty horrible model. 3. Ensure the company you are looking at has been around for more than a couple years. 4. You should make sure the product or service is something that you can see yourself using and enjoying.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does A Network Marketing Business Make Money?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The way someone in a network marketing business makes money is by signing up friends, family, or even strangers. As shown above, multilevel marketing has multiple levels of payment. In other words, there are various ways to make money. One way to earn money is through direct selling. As a sales associate of a network marketing business, you have exclusive access to certain products and pricing. With member only access you can sell products at retail cost, making a profit off the wholesale to retail margin. The most common way to start making a lot of money from a network marketing business is to recruit other sales associates. By recruiting other sales associates, you will make a profit off each product that they sell. Recruiting is the best way to make money because as an individual, you can only sell so much product. But if you recruit other sales associates, you can keep the money made from personal sales, while also earning a percentage of income from the sales associates that you recruit, aka your &ldquo;downline.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Top 5 Network Marketing Companies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are hundreds of network marketing companies in the United States. If you are trying to learn what the best network marketing companies are, then you are going to be bombarded with opinions. I recommend looking at only the facts! Determine what network marketing companies pay the most, earn the highest annual revenue, and how long the company has been around. Make sure to take all these things into consideration before deciding. A company that has been around for 50 years but does not pay well is useless. But a company that has been around for only one or two years that pays extremely well is also pointless. The whole point of a network marketing business is to build long term wealth. So, finding a company that has been around and will continue to be around will help you determine the best network marketing company to join. Here is a list of the five best network marketing companies in the U.S based on the total revenue, year est., and the number of &ldquo;Sales associates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Avon Products &ndash; 11.3 billion annual sales &ndash; 6.5 million sales associates &ndash; est. 1886</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Avon (beauty, fashion, jewelry, apparel) is the leader in annual sales and was est. long before most other companies. However, if you notice they have the most sales associates which means their annual sales are being split up amongst a ton of people. 11.3 billion / 6.5 million = $1738 per associate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Amway &ndash; 10.9 billion annual sales &ndash; 3.0 million sales associates &ndash; est. 1959</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Amway (cosmetics, personal care, food and beverage, home care, wellness) came second in annual sales and was est. over 50 years ago. When you focus on the amount of revenue per sales associate, Amway income more than doubles Avon. 10.9 billion / 3.0 million = $3633 per associate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Herbalife &ndash; 3.5 billion annual sales &ndash; 2.7 million sales associates &ndash; est. 1980</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Herbalife (cosmetics and personal care) came third in annual sales and was est. over 30 years ago. When it comes to the amount of revenue per sales associate, Herbalife does worse than Avon and Amway. 3.5 billion / 2.7 million = $1296 per associate</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mary Kay Inc. &ndash; 2.9 billion annual sales &ndash; 2.4 million sales associates &ndash; est. 1963</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary Kay Inc. (cosmetics and personal care) came in fourth in annual sales and was est. over 40 years ago. When it comes to the amount of revenue per sales associate, they come in fourth. 2.9 billion / 2.4 million = $1208 per associate</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tupperware Brands &ndash; 2.6 billion annual sales &ndash; 2.6 million sales associates &ndash; est. 1946</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Tupperware Brands Corp. (storage and serving products; beauty, personal care) comes in last for annual sales. However, they were est. over 60 years ago which is impressive. When it comes to the amount of revenue per sales associate they come in last. 2.6 billion / 2.6 million = $1000 per associate. When you break it all down, you must determine what is most important to you. Each of these companies has been around long enough to show some serious consistency and reliability. It is very unlikely that companies this size, that have been around this long will be going anywhere. You can also be confident that none of them are operating illegal pyramid schemes. Avon is slightly ahead of Amway in the overall annual sales, but their revenue per associate is very far behind Amway. Whatever company you choose, make sure to look at this vital information before making your decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#1 Best Network Marketing Company</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, fine! You don&rsquo;t want to do the research yourself; you want us to tell you who we think the very best network marketing company is. Choosing a network marketing company is a difficult decision and can be different for every single person. Just because we believe one company is the top network marketing company does not mean that it is. Depending on the products you have a passion for, your answer could be completely different. First, we encourage you to look at each website of the network marketing companies you are considering. Look at their product line and see if there is anything you like. If it is NOT a product that you could see yourself promoting, then immediately cross that company off your list. No matter what anyone says, the best network marketing company is the one that you believe in the most. Just make sure you can back up your beliefs with some logic. Since we are not you, we don&rsquo;t know what your passions are. All we can do is take the formula shown above and apply it to various companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The top network marketing company in our opinion would have to be Amway.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No, Find My Profession is not affiliated with Amway or any network marketing company in any way. We are just educating you on the networking marketing business model and aim to provide information to our readers to help them make wise decisions. We have chosen Amway as the top network marketing company for a few simple reasons: 1) They have stood the test of time. Having been around for almost sixty years, you can be certain Amway is not going anywhere. 2) They are very close to being the top revenue producers out of every network marketing company in the world. 3) They are in over 80 markets across the world 4) They have the widest variety of products. Instead of selling makeup for Avon, or kitchen containers for Tupperware Brands Corp., Amway has the most products and variety by far. 5) They pay the most! When it comes down to it, you want to make money. From our formula, Amway is the place to be if you are looking to make the most profit. For those simple reasons, we chose Amway. Again, if you are very passionate about another product and have run the numbers to find out that it is profitable, go with them! Just make sure they have been around for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Top multi-level marketing company</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people will ask &quot;what is the top multi-level marketing company,&quot; thinking that this is different than the top network marketing company. These things are the same! Network marketing company, multi-level marketing company, MLM company, they are all the same. Don&rsquo;t get thrown off by the various names that these companies have.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Multi-Level Marketing Companies List</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t like what we have had to say so far and you just want a multi-level marketing companies list, here you go!

According to the US Census Bureau, the median earning for an individual working full-time in the United States was $45,997 in 2015. Of course, this is just an average. Depending on your location, these averages could vary drastically. According to the Census Bureau, as of March 2013, only 6.03 percent of individuals over 18 bring in over $100,000 per year. Now, enough statistics, let&rsquo;s get to what you came here for. For the sake of this article, we are going to separate these six figure careers into three categories: medical related positions, non-medical, and jobs that do not require college degrees. The reason we are doing this is because so many of the six-figure careers are in the medical industry, but many people are not interested in advanced degrees or medicine. Here are the most common six-figure jobs according to <strong><a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a></strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Medical Six-Figure Careers</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the highest paying jobs in the world require medical degrees. While pursuing a medical degree will almost guarantee a high six-figure career, it is one of the least populated jobs around. In other words, for every surgeon making six-figures, there are ten finance managers also making six-figures. The average surgeon on average might make a higher salary than the finance manager, but it can be a very difficult and timely process to become a surgeon.See below for a list of the nine most common medical six-figure careers. <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/Physicians-and-surgeons.htm\"><strong>Surgeons</strong></a> Experienced Salary: $194,323 Job Description: Operate on patients to treat injuries, broken bones, diseases, etc. <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291064.htm\"><strong>Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists</strong></a> ExperiencedSalary: $189,912 Job Description: Provide medical care during pregnancy and childbirth.

Don\'t listen to opinions! Instead, learn 5 tips to create an executive level resume from the resume experts.','<p>An up to date resume is always great to have in your professional holster. You never know when a great opportunity will present itself, beginning with &ldquo;Send me your resume&hellip;&rdquo;. Many professionals will try and rush through the process, but that will only hurt you in the long run! Use the following tips to create an executive level resume that will bring you the results you are looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#1 - Start From The Top</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We will assume that you know how to add your name and contact information to the top of your resume so we will skip right past that&hellip; An executive summary is extremely important for a senior level position! This is where you explain in a brief, strategic message, what you can do for the company. This summary does not need to be rewritten for every single job you apply for, but it should be tweaked towards a specific industry and job title. If you are still using an objective statement to begin your resume, you need to get with the ages. An objective statement is where you state your objectives and career goals. We are sorry to break it to you, but most companies do not care about what they can do to further your career. Rather, they want to know what you are bringing to the table to benefit the organization. Focus on your experience and qualifications in your summary to set the tone for your executive level resume!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sample Summary by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">Find My Profession</a>:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Successful, accomplished senior level Sales Operations leader skilled with proven strategic vision and the ability to develop and execute on complex commercial plans to increase profitability. Adept at delivering expansive growth, operational productivity, proactive insights and sales force effectiveness through the development of talent, organizations, and systems. Entrepreneurial, versatile and innovative business leader, skilled at using data and analytics. Effective and persuasive communicator with a natural ability to interact seamlessly with executives, personnel, and customers, specializing in making the complex simple and easy to understand and leading with a resourceful, collaborative, hands-on style.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#2 - Create A Strategy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that your situation is unique from anyone else that is looking for a six-figure job. Don&rsquo;t waste time looking for a one size fits all solution, instead spend that time wisely strategizing your own solution. How many opportunities are available for the position, location, and salary that you are looking for? If you are willing to work anywhere in the U.S. and accept a wide salary range, then you may not need to edit your resume as often as someone else. You have the law of large numbers on your side, and the luxury of applying to many different positions that fit your criteria. Plus, applying to jobs can be an annoying task. Don&rsquo;t make it harder on yourself by sending 1,000 customized applications. Contrary, if you are a Manager, Director, or VP who isn&rsquo;t willing to relocate, and is very set on a specific salary, you might notice that there are very few jobs for you to apply for. You do not have the law of large numbers on your side. This makes it very important to submit the highest quality executive level resume to each job you apply for. If you only find ten jobs a month that are a good fit for you, you better make sure you have sent ten executive resumes that are slightly tweaked towards each position. Your executive level resume is no different than anything else. Take dating for example... you might try a few cheesy pick-up lines before you find one that works. You can do that because you have millions of options. But if you only had five choices, you would make sure that you brought your A-Game every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#3 - But Can You Quantify It?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Accomplishments can be one of the most challenging components of your executive resume. You would be surprised at the number of resumes that come across my desk with bullet points that describe the job duties of the position. Please believe me when I tell you that the person reading your resume is smart enough to know what the typical Director of Sales Operations does day-to-day. A quick Google search on &ldquo;Director of Sales Operations Job Description&rdquo; can tell you that. The hiring manager expects to see a lot more than job duties on your executive level resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&ldquo;WE WANT ACHIEVEMENTS!&rdquo;</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You heard the man&hellip; He wants achievements. When you are writing, your executive level resume you absolutely must quantify your achievements whenever possible. I understand this is easier to do for sales positions then it would be for an English Teacher but do your best. If you increased sales at your company&hellip; By what percentage? What new markets were you able to enter? What projects did you lead and what were the outcomes (don&rsquo;t mention the bad ones)? These are all questions hiring managers are asking in their head while reviewing your executive level resume. Quantify achievements and explain the outcome of each major task that you completed. Be specific, and if you don&rsquo;t know exact figures, ballpark, and (don&rsquo;t inflate) estimate. Don&rsquo;t skip this step; I promise it is the most important part of your entire resume. Think about it for a second. If a hiring manager receives 50 resumes for a VP of Sales Operations position, you can assume that a vast majority of those resumes are from someone with a sales operations background. Maybe they served as a VP somewhere else, or maybe they are a Director looking to climb the ranks. The point is, everyone has similar experience levels. If you send a resume describing your job duties, you are no different than the other 49 resumes being submitted. Stand out, show off your achievements that everyone else left off their resume and secure your interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sample Achievements by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.findmyprofession.com/\">www.findmyprofession.com</a>:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Led creation, implementation, and training of activity dashboards, improving visibility and metrics of sales representative&rsquo;s sales coverage (increase of 15%), call per week (increase of 55%) and co-travels with managers (increase of 20%).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Conceived, developed, and implemented first-ever identification of 50,000 retail outlets into field and Account Manager reports, resulting in optimization of sales force effort to highest potential targets and the creation of a new marketing pull-through strategy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Dramatically revised compensation, forecasting, and quota allocation programs to enhance strategic alignment, increase sales force engagement and maximize attainment curves at territory, region, and area levels.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>#4 - No Need for Fancy Designs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about a million opinions out there on how you should design your resume. At the end of the day, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I am sorry that you paid $1,000 for a fancy looking resume that doesn&rsquo;t bring results. It&rsquo;s time to start fresh. We have proven time and time again that your achievements and work experience speak louder than any font, color, or formatting on your executive level resume. Don&rsquo;t get caught up in these fancy designs that are created to attract you to some resume service. No design in the world is going to get you an interview if the content is garbage. Also, everybody has a different opinion on what looks good. If you send your fancy resume to one recruiter, they might love it. But you can easily send that resume to another recruiter, who happens to hate the color red. Don&rsquo;t risk your future position on silly recruiter bias. The content on your executive level resume is king, and everyone can appreciate good content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#5 - Buy Into The Process</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you like it or not, if you want a job, you must play the game. Recruiters and hiring managers love to believe that you are only applying to their company, that you are not using your resume for any other job openings, and that you spent many hours crafting a resume just for their eyes. Ha! That is hilarious. Who has time for that? As unrealistic as this is, this is truly what companies expect out of their applicants. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I have heard recruiters complain that someone sent a resume that was not 100% tailored towards the job posting. They clearly have no idea how time-consuming the process of applying for jobs can be. This goes back to the point we made about being strategic. Sometimes it is best to customize your resume towards a particular job, and other times it isn&rsquo;t. How confident are you that your skills align with the job? Do you feel extremely qualified? Without ever speaking with the hiring manager, would they be able to look at your executive level resume and feel confident in your abilities? If the answer is yes, send the resume as is. If you feel like you have the skills for this position and you want the job, but your resume just doesn&rsquo;t quite show off the specific skills required, then customize it! It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Executive Level Resume Service</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By implementing the tips above, you will begin to see dramatic increases in application to interview conversion. If you are like most senior level executives, writing a resume is the last thing you have time to do, but you understand it is a necessity to find a new position.
