Whether you have gone through a layoff, or you want to move forward in your career, we can help ease the pain with our career finder. With over 50 years of experience in HR, we know the right people, practice the best trends, and most importantly, bring better results than anyone else. We are so confident, our career finder comes with a <strong>100% Satisfaction Guarantee.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find My Profession specializes in finding six figure careers for professionals in all industries across the United States. This includes Senior Manager careers, Director careers, VP careers, Executive careers, and any other career that offers six-figure jobs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>The job seeker (YOU) is our only focus</strong>.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No, we are not recruiters. No, we are not a staffing agency. We do not take a huge percentage of your salary like recruiters (20% on average). You invest a small, one-time payment (around 1% of your salary), and we&nbsp;do ALL the work for you from the resume and job applications all the way to the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our career finder brings you tremendous results by utilizing hundreds of industry specific professional groups, over 100,000 professional connections, 90+ job boards, and a variety of other resources. When you add it all up, we have access to over 2.5 million recruiters and hiring managers across the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason our career finder is so successful is simple. Recruiters charge hiring managers around 20% of your annual salary in order to place you in a new role. We charge hiring managers nothing. This allows us to work with (not for) tens of thousands of companies. Instead of spending time signing contracts and gaining new business with the hiring manager, we spend that time working for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answer me this, if you were a hiring manager, would you prefer to hire:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Option 1) A free referral sent to you by Find My Profession.<br />\r\nOption 2) A lead that would cost you an additional 20% on top of their annual salary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, who wouldn&#39;t select Option 1? This business model gives us the competitive advantage and allows our clients (you) to stand out. Since we don&#39;t work for any hiring managers directly,&nbsp;there are absolutely no limitations on where we can find you a job. Your agenda is our agenda. Removing these limitations exponentially increases your chances of being hired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you are changing careers and make at least $100,000 per year, our career finder service is your golden ticket to your next job.
